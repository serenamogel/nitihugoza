Having amassed a strong fan base of over 140,000 followers as a result of publishing videos on a consistently regular basis, a sudden, total blackout last week immediately triggered concern among fans.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>And then came the news that everyone had feared. Speaking in a video published on their own personal TikTok account, friend TheGreatLondini revealed that CyberMax had recently passed away. “I am greatly saddened by the news that, today, we lost my friend CyberMax,” they said, adding “He was one of the most kind and giving people I have ever met.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true><a title=@thegreatlondini.com href=#>@thegreatlondini.com</a><p>CYBERMAX <a title=rip href=#>#RIP</a> <a title=cybermaxoutreach href=#>#cybermaxoutreach</a> @cybermax.official <a title=greatlondini href=#>#greatlondini</a> <a title=voiceeffects href=#>#voiceeffects</a></p><a title="♬ See You Again (Piano Arrangement) - Alexandre Pachabezian" href=#>♬ See You Again (Piano Arrangement) – Alexandre Pachabezian</a></figure><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Naturally, TheGreatLondini’s announcement has resulted in a flood of comments on Cybermax’s most recent videos mourning his passing which, as of writing, has yet to be confirmed in any official fashion. In light of the circumstances of his apparent death remaining a complete mystery, some outlets are positing that the entire event could be some brand of poor-taste hoax. Again, for reasons unknown.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Regardless of specifics, folks on TikTok have taken the announcement at face value and responded by publically mourning CyberMax on the platform that earned him a legion of loyal viewers despite no public statement from the entertainer’s friends or family confirming his death.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook wp-block-embed-facebook" data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=585 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>In fact, the only anecdotal information concerning CyberMax’s next of kin informing anyone of what happened comes from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Militia</a>, which claims that a user, ‘Hauntmama’ “said on the internet” that his sisters informed TheGreatLondini of their brother’s passing and that the children’s mother had discovered his body while accompanied by a friend. As of writing, WGTC has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the above, with the only fact remaining to be that CyberMax hasn’t posted any new content since news of his death broke.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>In truth, regulars of CybeMax’s TikTok page will have to wait and see what, if anything, transpires.
