While some people are lucky enough to have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>naturally clear skin</a> that boasts a uniform tone, others work hard to achieve it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Several factors influence the amount of pigment the skin makes, translating into how even or uneven the skin's tone is. So, whether you spent one too many summer days in the sun or your hormone levels cause <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>melasma</a> to come out full force at the drop of a hat, uneven skin tone can be frustrating, especially when the rest of the skin is in pretty good shape. The key to preventing an uneven skin tone is to control the factors that stimulate excess melanin production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, three dermatologists share their tried-and-true solutions for preventing uneven skin tone and treating it when it becomes a concern.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-uneven-skin-tone></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Uneven Skin Tone?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Uneven skin tone, which can affect all skin colors and types, lacks uniformity in color. Melanin gives the skin its pigment, but too much of it can cause areas of discoloration, known as hyperpigmentation. Spots, redness, or blotchiness also count as uneven skin tone. Uneven skin tone is usually, but not always, accompanied by a rough or dry texture.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-main-causes-of-uneven-skin-tone></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Main Causes of Uneven Skin Tone</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no one reason for uneven skin tone; a combination of factors can lead to skin discoloration. According to board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sonia Badreshia-Bansal</a>, sun exposure is the most common reason for uneven skin tone. "UV radiation from the sun triggers the production of melanin, and overexposing the skin to sunlight can lead to uneven pigmentation," she says. The sun also negatively impacts the skin's texture.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While we'd like to think that the sun is the only culprit of less-than-evenly-toned skin, it's not. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which occurs after inflammation within the skin, typical of acne, eczema, a rash, wound, or burn, causes the affected area to heal darker due to increased melanin production. Board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Monika Kiripolsky</a> adds that hormonal imbalances during pregnancy or fertility treatments can cause melasma (pregnancy mask), which are dark, uneven patches and spots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or Addison's disease, can also impact hormonal balance and contribute to pigmentation issues. Board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Margarita Lolis</a> says lifestyle choices and external environmental factors, including pollution, sun exposure, smoking, trauma, and poor nutrition, can contribute to hyperpigmentation, too. "Any exogenous causes of oxidative stress and increased melanin and melanocyte production impacts the skin's tone," she adds. On the flip side, certain skin conditions like psoriasis, vitiligo, and certain forms of dermatitis can cause areas of hypopigmentation where the skin lacks melanin.</p><p>As the skin naturally ages, the rate at which cell turnover occurs begins to slow down, leading to a buildup of dead skin cells and a decrease in collagen production. Dr. Badreshia-Bansal says this combination can result in a dull complexion accessorized with uneven skin tone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Kiripolsky, uneven skin tone can occur at any stage of life. "It's more common in women due to hormonal imbalances, which typically occur around the time of pregnancy and menopause," she shares. "Discoloration from inflammatory acne can start in the mid to late teens and persist until the 40s. And uneven skin color from sun exposure starts as freckles during the teenage years and becomes more noticeable as larger sunspots in the 30s and beyond."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-uneven-skin-tone></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Uneven Skin Tone</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The skin gods don't predetermine uneven skin tone, and there's plenty you can do to keep unnecessary pigment at bay. "A solid skincare routine can prevent and correct uneven skin tone," Dr. Lolis says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sunscreen is essential since the sun is enemy number one. As Dr. Lolis explains, ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress promote melanin production during a process called melanogenesis, which occurs in melanocyte cells responsible for producing melanin. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunscreens </a>block UVA and UVB rays from penetrating the skin, thereby decreasing oxidative stress, DNA damage, and melanogenesis."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sun can also worsen conditions like rosacea, acne, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Wearing sunscreen daily helps shield the skin from harmful UV rays to prevent the formation or worsening of hyperpigmentation, sunspots, freckles, and melasma. Look for a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 or more and reapply it every two hours. Our pick is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Julep No Excuses Broad Spectrum Invisible Sunscreen Gel For Face SPF 40 </a>($28), which contains rosehip oil to help even the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regular cleansing, exfoliation, antioxidant protection, and hydration should also comprise a well-rounded skincare routine. Dr. Badreshia-Bansal says gentle exfoliation removes dead skin cells to prevent a buildup of pigmented cells and reveal fresh skin cells. "It's also important to hydrate the skin to maintain its barrier function and prevent dryness and irritation, which can contribute to uneven pigmentation," she adds. Since free radicals are a culprit of unevenly toned skin, using antioxidant-rich serums rich in vitamin C, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Alastin Skincare's C-RADICAL Defense Antioxidant Serum</a> ($178), will help mitigate excessive pigment.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ingredients-and-treatments-to-try></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ingredients and Treatments to Try</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you do your best to keep discoloration at bay, there's a chance that unwanted pigment can still take up residence on your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blocking melanin synthesis is a key part of treating uneven skin tone. Dermatologists often prescribe hydroquinone, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinol</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>kojic</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>tranexamic acids</a> to regulate melanin production. "However, hydroquinone, a bleaching agent, can be irritating, leave halos, and not always effective because it is hard to penetrate the skin," Dr. Lolis says. "Recent studies have found that tranexamic acid has a hypopigmentary effect because of its mechanism of action. Inflammatory mediators and metabolites that are released from clots can stimulate melanin production," she explains. "Since tranexamic acid slows and inhibits clot breakdown, there is a decrease in the level of clot metabolites causing melanogenesis." Other ingredients to incorporate include vitamin C, niacinamide, and alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), which address pigmentation issues by increasing exfoliation, Dr. Badreshia-Bansal says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At-home chemical peels, like Dr<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>. Lancer's Caviar Acid Lime Peel</a> ($99), which employ glycolic, salicylic, lactic, tranexamic, and kojic acids, can also help exfoliate the uppermost layer of skin to promote cell turnover and reduce hyperpigmentation. But if your skin calls for something more powerful, schedule an appointment with your dermatologist for a medical-grade exfoliating chemical peel. Dr. Badreshia-Bansal says professional chemical peels and other exfoliating treatments help remove layers of pigmented skin, revealing a more even tone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lasers like intense pulsed light (IPL, which is more effective at reducing redness and brown pigment) and Moxi and Fraxel (for deeper pigmentation) are also helpful for correcting uneven pigment in the skin by breaking down excessive melanin. Dr. Lolis adds that Nd: YAG picosecond lasers work well for spot-treating individual sunspots. "It uses short bursts of energy to shatter melanin into small particles, which the skin can absorb," she says. "Think of it like breaking a rock into sand, which is then slowly swept away."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">CO2 and erbium resurfacing lasers improve uneven color by removing damaged skin layers and promoting collagen remodeling for better skin texture. Microneedling treatments with radiofrequency can also help improve unevenly toned skin and texture. No matter which treatment your dermatologist feels is best for improving your uneven skin tone, Dr. Badreshia-Bansal says, "consistency is key, and the results may take time."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqyfYrK3sc1mqqShnmLBsLrEZm5yb2Fohnc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
