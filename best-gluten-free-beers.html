Yes, beer is generally packed with glutenous grains, but plenty of brands—in their benevolence—have figured out how to make perfectly delicious gluten-free and reduced-gluten brews.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t want to just gloss over what I just said: Some of the beers on this list are reduced gluten rather than totally gluten free. Gluten-free beers are generally brewed with gluten-free grains like corn, millet, and sorghum. Gluten-reduced beers are brewed with an enzyme that breaks down gluten, but research on whether gluten-reduced beers are safe for people who are gluten intolerant is apparently inconclusive. If you are gluten intolerant, it’s probably wise to stick to gluten-free brews (or, you know, drinks that are naturally gluten free, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hard seltzer</a>).</p><p>Okay, I don’t need to micromanage your gluten consumption—I just need to tell you which gluten-free beers taste good, right? Without further ado, these are the best gluten-free beers (and the best gluten-reduced beers) we tried during our in-office taste test.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

To brew this gluten-free beer, Anhueser-Busch ditched barley in favor of sorghum to create a lager that’s light, refreshing, and totally palatable. Nothing about this beer is going to set your taste buds on fire, but if you’re looking for something to replace that domestic dad beer you drink too many of during football games, Redbridge is the best gluten-free beer you can buy.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Total Wine & Spirits</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_GF-BEER_INSET-02-reduced.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Gluten Reduced</p><strong>Omission</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Total Wine & Spirits</a><p>When I ordered some cans of Omission for this taste test, I didn’t realize they were gluten reduced rather than gluten free. But if you aren’t hard-core gluten insensitive and are just looking for a way to casually reduce your gluten intake, I think these brews are still worth a look (or, er, a sip). Both the Golden Ale and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wheat Ale</a> from Omission are super light, lovely, and quaffable; if you like a little bit of citrusy twang to your beer, opt for the wheat ale. Bonus: They’re super low carb and just feel nice and light as you drink. In my notes I said, “These are two of the best beers I’ve had in general lately,” and that stands!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Total Wine & Spirits</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_GF-BEER_INSET-05-reduced.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Glutenberg</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Total Wine & Spirits</a><p>All in all, Glutenberg makes the best gluten-free beer we tasted. I tried three varieties for this taste test—White, Stout, and IPA—and honestly can’t pick a favorite. They’re all exceptional and they’re all brewed with alternative grains like corn, millet, and buckwheat. If you’re into the fresh, citrusy taste of a Belgian White, opt for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glutenberg White</a>. If you like the grassy, floral nature of a hoppy brew, go for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glutenberg IPA</a>. Glutenberg Stout was my personal favorite—it’s rich, chocolatey, and has a nice creamy head. I’d drink it in lieu of dessert, but these are tasty enough to enjoy any time. If you can get your gluten-free mitts on Glutenberg beer, buy some.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Total Wine & Spirits</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite foods with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFus8uuq56mXZu%2FprGMm5yeqqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
