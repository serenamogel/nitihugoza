Trebek told journalists he felt extremely lucky for their good thoughts, positive energy, and prayers. "After you’re dead, people say, ‘Oh, he was such a good guy, we really liked him.’ But I am getting all that before that event.

When he finally went in for testing, doctors found a tumor the size of a small fist in his pancreas and diagnosed him with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the most advanced stage. “It sounds impressive – I've got stage 4 cancer, okay? Not stage 1, for sissies, that's just beginner's cancer. I've got advanced!" Trebek said in an interview with Jane Pauley on CBS T<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeopardy-host-alex-trebek-on-his-cancer-diagnosis/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his Morning" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">his Morning</a> in mid-May.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cancer of the pancreas is one of the deadliest forms of the disease. Only about nine percent of patients who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for five years, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society (ACS)" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">American Cancer Society (ACS)</a>, although survival rates vary depending on many factors including the stage of cancer and whether it comes back following treatment. The ACS <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/CRC/PDF/Public/8778.00.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="also estimates" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">also estimates</a> that about one in 64 Americans are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in their lifetime, and nearly all patients are over the age of 45 at the time of diagnosis. Trebek was 78 when he was diagnosed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The game show host said in interviews that he recognizes the chances of survival are “very, very low,” but he's not worried about dying — just the effect it would have on his loved ones, including his wife of 29 years, Jean Currivan, and his two adult children, Matthew and Emily. “[They] look at me as Mr. Strong, and if anybody’s going to beat this, Dad will. They’re very positive,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/health/alex-trebek-cancer-journey-eased-by-wife-jean/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Chemotherapy made the talk show host depressed</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Trebek appeared on Good Morning America in May 2019 to discuss his cancer diagnosis and his struggle against depression during chemotherapy. He said he often felt down the day after treatment and managing his cancer caused “surges of deep, deep sadness” that brought him to tears: “Chemo affects people in different ways…There is nothing wrong with saying, ‘Hey, I am really depressed today and I have no idea why. Why am I crying today?’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chemo also caused Trebek to lose his hair and sense of taste, and suffer agonizing stomach cramps — which he described as jumping from a three to an 11 on the pain scale — while taping Jeopardy!.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite the challenges, Trebek said he tried to take things in stride, joking with nurses during chemo. Jeopardy! executive producer Harry Friedman told People that Trebek’s stoicism is real and “shows everyone who he is.”</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Trebek's had 'mind-boggling' results from the chemo</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In mid-May 2019, Trebek’s oncologists told him that he was responding extremely well to chemotherapy. "It's kind of mind-boggling. ... The doctors said they hadn't seen this kind of positive result in their memory ... some of the tumors have already shrunk by more than 50 percent," Trebek <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/health/alex-trebek-pancreatic-cancer-near-remission/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since his diagnosis, Trebek used his platform to raise awareness about the disease and money for pancreatic cancer research, even speaking at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pancan.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s</a> PurpleStride walk to end pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles in May 2019. “If I’m going to be the public spokesperson for pancreatic cancer, my message is this: ‘Let’s be positive,’” he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/health/alex-trebek-has-a-message-for-pancreatic-cancer-patients-it-doesnt-have-to-end-in-death/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">After a setback, Trebek admitted he's 'not afraid of dying'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In September 2019, Trebek revealed he was ordered for another round of chemo. “I was doing so well. And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer. So we were all very optimistic. And they said, 'Good, we're gonna stop chemo, we'll start you on immunotherapy,'" he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/jeopardy-host-alex-trebek-undergoing-chemotherapy-numbers-sky-65651536 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Good Morning America" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Good Morning America</a>. "I lost about 12 pounds in a week. And my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed. So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again and that's what I'm doing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He gave another update in October 2019, telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/alex-trebek-tells-lisa-laflamme-i-m-not-afraid-of-dying-1.4625438 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CTV News" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">CTV News</a>, "I’m not afraid of dying.
