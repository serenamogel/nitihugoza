A digital “ghost trace” of Dowland also brought no results without it suggesting the term Dowland, Wisconsin to many users as Google search autocorrect and recommended search options.</span></p><p><span>This event is similar to Langville, Montana.No ARG or online propaganda campaign can be linked to the city, unlike that “disappearing city”, which first started appearing in online mentions in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Doveland_Wisconsin_Theories></span><span><strong>Doveland Wisconsin Theories</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>There are two Theories about Doveland, Wisconsin.</span></p><ul><li><span>A hoax</span></li><li><span>Vanished town</span></li></ul><p><span><strong><span><span>Doveland, Wisconsin </span>Theories</span></strong></span></p><ul><li><span>A hoax, tall tale or internet legend. The lacking evidence and information on this town could be explained as a coverup but more plausibly it could be a mass delusion or urban legend.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Similar to Werner, a town or unorganized settlement that was destroyed by damming. However, the cities that ‘disappeared’ in this way were well documented historically.</span></li><li><span>It has been suggested that T-shirts and mugs associated with Doveland may be examples of bot-generated advertisements based on users’ recent search history.</span></li><li><span>A city that at this time was scattered into separate rural townships due to the failing economy, or a military city that was abandoned once it was out of operation. Some have suggested ‘Project Sanguine’ of the ’80s as an explanation for Dowland’s sudden disappearance.</span></li><li><span>A city that was destroyed by the state due to a military science experiment gone wrong.</span></li><li><span>A town that literally disappeared from existence.</span></li><li><span>A superstition or an idea acts backwards to bring about its own reality. In short, although it did not exist at first, Dowland’s ideas as told in modern stories may retrospectively give it some footing in reality. A famous literary example is in ‘Tlon, Ucbar, Orbis Tertius’ (1940) by the magic-realist Jorge Luis Borges. The world of Tlön begins as fictional in the story, with the protagonist actively seeking out footnotes and rare documents with fleeting references to the supposedly fantastic place. As the story progresses Tlön takes on an increasingly physical reality with an established history and relics. The story parallels how Dowland emerged from a mysterious Google search suggestion, and then grew through research to the point that it became a kind of reality in the memory of real Wisconsinites.</span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikkamytMDIp5mopJyuxLC7w2eaqKVfmby3scuapZ1lp57ApLvNrKCnZaeeuKp51qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2LBqbGMnaavnZyWu6V51qKqnKeeqLavedOhnKiqmZrAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
