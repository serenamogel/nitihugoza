Some of us prefer a slender <a href=#>fettuccine</a>, others insist on the total supremacy of the elbow macaroni, but there are a few folks out there who know that, deep down, the best pasta shape is the mighty farfalle. Chances are you’ve had a dish that incorporated these little beauties, but what are farfalle, really? Well, we’re here to guide you!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-farfalle><strong>What is farfalle?</strong></h2><p>Known to many as the “bowtie” pasta because it’s shaped like a bowtie, farfalle has been satisfying pasta cravings since the 1500s when it was first created in northern Italy. The word “farfalle” actually comes from the word “farfalla,” which means butterfly in Italian. Farfalle start as rectangular pieces of pasta, which are then pinched in the middle, creating their unique shape (which apparently looks like a piece of clothing to us Americans and beautiful butterflies to Italians).
