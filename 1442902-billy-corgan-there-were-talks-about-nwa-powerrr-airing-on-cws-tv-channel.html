On February 6, the show kicked off a new era. The premiere of the new season aired on the CW app and the CW website.

He stated that The CW decided having Powerrr air on the streaming side was the better approach.&nbsp;(H/t Andrew Thompson of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POST Wrestling</a> for the transcription)</p><p>“When people heard that we were gonna be on the streaming side (of The CW), there were a few raised eyebrows as if this was some sort of kick in the shin and we had talked to CW at different times about being on the broadcast side versus the streaming but they just decided the streaming side was the better side for us,” Billy Corgan said. “I think it’s because they knew what was coming.</p><p>“Of course, they’re more inside on the baseball than we are and of course with them signing NXT on the broadcast side but, being on a streaming service is a huge deal. The level of competition is really fierce as you see so this is a big move for us and it’s hopefully a big step into a bigger future.”</p><p>As previously announced, WWE NXT is moving to The CW in October 2024, and Corgan noted that this may have been a factor in the decision.</p><p>Catch up on our coverage of the latest episode of Powerrr <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtaXJoYmKvqrjLsmScp6Kcrq9506Gcq51drLKzsYytmKWjo2Kuo7vUrWSnr5FivbDDxKupq2WRnr%2BqusZmpqdlk6zAbsDVZpqhmZ6jsq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
