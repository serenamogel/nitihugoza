At Ring of Honor Death Before Dishonor, Love will challenge Woman of Honor World Champion Kelly Klein for the championship. In a recent edition of 10 Questions,&nbsp; a series <a href=#>on Ring of Honor Wrestling’s website</a>, Angelina Love discussed the importance of the Women of Honor World Championship, an unnerving experience with a stalker and more. Transcription credit of rohwrestling.com.</p><p>Love: “Unfortunately, I had a stalker in the UK give me some of the most uncomfortable experiences ever. One experience was when he flew from London to Las Vegas to watch one of my fitness competitions and somehow knew what hotel we were staying in and where we would be at every moment. Came to breakfast buffet and sat at our table and also walked 10 steps behind us on the strip the following day. He recorded me on stage in my bikini. Bought me diamond earrings and left them at the front desk of my hotel. Got on my Facebook page and started asking me about family members in my photos (my page is now private). Waited by a slot machine by the front doors of the hotel at 4 a.m. when I was leaving to almost knock me over with hugs before I flew home. There were more encounters with him but that was definitely one of the worst.”</p><p>LoveIt would mean a lot to me. I worked a few shows for Ring of Honor back in 2004 and now being back here again with so much more time and experience under my belt gives me a tremendous hunger to show everyone here, and continue to show the entire world, why I am one of the best women’s wrestlers ever. I am champion material, always have been and always will be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBsbmxsYWKur7PEpaCnmV2hvLexjKilZqyYmnq4u8yepWanlmK1sLrOq2StoaShsm6tjKyamqqpYrK5vMSroJ6mk5p6uLXToWSaZaOprq23xKtkmqaUYrqwvsQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
