What exactly is 811? Preventing yourself and others from accidently harming underground utility wires may be accomplished by dialling the number 811 prior to beginning any digging. It is estimated that there are millions of miles of buried utilities under the surface of the ground, including utilities that are essential to daily life, such as water, electricity, and natural gas, among others.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><h3>What do the blue stake lines on the ground mean?</h3><p>Temporary survey markers in the colour pink.
