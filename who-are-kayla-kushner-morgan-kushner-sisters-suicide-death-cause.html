They were adored daughters, grandchildren, nieces, and friends.</p><p>On Sunday, January 9, 2022, they left the world as they had entered it.</p><p>Their death has left a void in the lives of their parents, family members, loved ones, and friends, but everyone who knew them knows they left the world a better place than they found it.</p><p>As they grew into passionate, independent women, Morgan and Kayla shared the unique bond of twin sisters and best friends, encouraging and supporting one another.</p><p>As children, they were homeschooled by their mother, Mary, in their hometown of Advance, North Carolina.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kayla-kushner-morgan-kushner-sisters-suicide></span>Kayla Kushner & Morgan Kushner- Sisters Suicide<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kayla Kushner and Morgan Kushner died on January 9, 2022. Suicide is a possibility, according to speculation. However, there has been no official confirmation that the twins committed suicide.</p><p>The respected authority is investigating the case and will conclude soon. Both sisters were doing well, so it isn’t easy to believe they took their own lives.</p><p>Their social media posts have yet to receive any RIP messages. Kayla was said to be a digital marketing and content creation expert. On the other hand, Morgan used to counsel clients on social media and digital marketing.</p><p>Surprisingly, the sisters were about to launch a marketing and media consulting firm. But, sadly, their dream has now been dashed with their death.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kayla-kushner-morgan-kushner-death-cause></span>Kayla Kushner & Morgan Kushner- Death Cause<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Everyone who knew Kayla and Morgan Kushner was taken aback by their deaths. We pray that their souls will find eternal peace in heaven. But, unfortunately, we have not been able to determine the cause of their demise until now.</p><p>Furthermore, we have yet to confirm whether the two committed suicide or not. This is, indeed, a developing story. But, again, their family has not spoken about their death.</p><p>We must comprehend the situation and respect the privacy of their family. We want to express our condolences to the families of Kayla and Morgan.</p><p>Surprisingly, both sisters adored animals. Morgan had a rescue dog named Finch before they died. They were not only siblings but also best friends. It’s heartbreaking to realize they’re no longer with us.</p>&nbsp;<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmopqxnJZ6rMHSoaWeql2ivLOzwKdkpK2jnbumvoysoKyslafAbr%2FUopqinJVisaat06FknJmlqLJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
