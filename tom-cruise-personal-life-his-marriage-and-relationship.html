As a Hollywood star, he has won numerous honors, including an Honorary Palme d’Or and three Golden Globe Awards, as well as nominations for four Academy Awards.</p><p>His films have grossed more than $4 billion in North America and more than $11.5 billion globally, making him one of the highest-grossing box-office stars of all time. He is consistently one of the highest-paid actors in the world.</p><p>Cruise debuted as an actor in the early 1980s, with prominent roles in the comedy film Risky Business (1983) and the action blockbuster Top Gun (1986).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the marriage and relationship history of Tom Cruise?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Cruise</a> had relationships with Melissa Gilbert, Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher in the early to mid-1980s.</p><p>On May 9, 1987, Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers. On February 4, 1990, they divorced. Rogers grew up in Scientology and was one of its ‘auditors’; they met when Cruise became one of her customers.</p><p>In a 1993 Playboy interview, Rogers detailed her divorce from Cruise and revealed that he had considered becoming a monk, which had an impact on their closeness. Rogers later reversed her words, claiming they were misconstrued. Rogers’ divorce settlement was $4 million.</p><p>On the set of their 1990 picture Days of Thunder, Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman. On December 24, 1990, the pair tied the knot. They had two children through adoption: Isabella Jane (born in 1992) and Connor Antony (born in 1995). Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman in February 2001, while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy appeared to terminate in a miscarriage, but Kidman confirmed the rumors in 2007 by saying that she had an ectopic pregnancy.</p><p>Cruise was next romantically associated with Penélope Cruz, his Vanilla Sky (2001) co-star. Their three-year romance ended in 2004. According to a story in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair, after Cruise’s separation with Cruz, Scientologist authorities initiated a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend.</p><p>According to those reports, a series of “auditions” for Scientologist actresses led in a brief romance with Iranian-British actress Nazanin Boniadi, who later left Scientology. Vanity Fair was accused of “shoddy journalism” and “religious bigotry” by Scientology and Cruise’s lawyers, who issued emphatic denials and vowed to sue. Journalist Roger Friedman later said that he received an email corroborating the story from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis.</p><p>Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes in April 2005. Cruise and Holmes, called TomKat by the media, made their first public appearance together in Rome on April 27, of that year. A month later, on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Cruise openly confessed his love for Holmes; he leaped on Winfrey’s yellow couch and stood there to make the revelation.</p><p>According to media reports at the time, Oprah was caught aback by Cruise’s outburst, which diverted attention away from the intended promotion of Cruise’s latest picture, War of the Worlds. Cruise and Holmes announced their pregnancy on October 6, 2005.</p><p>Suri, their daughter, was born in April 2006. On November 18, Holmes and Cruise married in a Scientologist ceremony attended by numerous Hollywood stars at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano.</p><p>According to their publicists, the pair “officialized” their marriage the day before the Italian wedding in Los Angeles.</p><p>It’s widely assumed that their marriage was planned by the Church of Scientology. The chief of Scientology, David Miscavige, acted as Cruise’s best man. Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise on June 29, 2012. On 9 July, the couple signed a divorce agreement negotiated by their solicitors. Because New York law requires all divorce paperwork to be sealed, the actual terms of the settlement are not public knowledge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2mpmWTp8Kqv8Rmp56qo6S7oriMpaCfnV2dtrR5zJqpq6GRnLJurc2dZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
