An only child, Dean’s adored mother died of cancer when he was age 9 and he was sent to live on his aunt and uncle’s Quaker farm. He returned to California after graduating high school, studying theater at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After dropping out of college, the aspiring actor first appeared on television in a Pepsi advertisement followed by uncredited parts in minor Hollywood pictures before heading to New York City in 1951, where he studied at the Actors Studio under <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lee-strasberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lee Strasberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lee Strasberg</a>.

It would be the only film released prior to the actor’s death and for which he would be nominated posthumously for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 1955 Academy Awards. As misunderstood, rebellious Cal, the role foreshadowed Jim Stark, the late-adolescent, angst-ridden character he portrayed in Rebel Without a Cause (1955) alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/natalie-wood data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Natalie Wood" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Natalie Wood</a>, which would become a teen favorite of the era and forever be identified with the image and legacy of Dean, the tragic movie star.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fearing he would be typecast as an angry, rebellious teen, Dean’s next role was as a rags-to-riches Texan ranch hand in Giant (1956), co-starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/elizabeth-taylor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Taylor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elizabeth Taylor</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/rock-hudson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rock Hudson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rock Hudson</a>. It would be his final film and would garner him another posthumous Academy Award nomination, making him the only actor ever to be <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.oscars.org/collection-highlights/james-dean data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="nominated twice following death" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">nominated twice following death</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was soon after wrapping shooting on Giant that Dean returned to his other love – motorsport, in which he first competed professionally prior to filming Rebel Without a Cause.

Dean was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/james-dean-dies-in-car-accident data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ticketed for speeding" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">ticketed for speeding</a> at 3:30 p.m., just over two hours before his untimely death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dean was killed when the 550 Spyder he was driving collided with a Ford Tudor sedan along then-U.S. Route 446 near Cholame, California. The Ford, driven by 23-year-old Cal Poly student Donald Turnupseed, was turning at an intersection when the two cars hit almost head-on, resulting in massive damage to Dean’s Porsche. The actor died almost instantly while his passenger, Wütherich, was badly injured but survived.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His left foot crushed between the clutch and brake pedal, Dean’s neck was broken and he suffered massive internal injuries. Along with Wütherich, he was transported to the Paso Robles War Memorial hospital 28 miles away where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 6:20 p.m. As well as a broken neck, both his arms were broken, he had fractures of the upper and lower jaw and massive internal injuries. Wütherich suffered a fractured jaw, fractured hip and body lacerations. Turnupseed received only minor injuries and after being interviewed by attending California Highway Patrol officers at the scene, was released.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Dean's legacy has grown in the decades since his death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An inquest into the crash in the days following found Dean at fault due to speeding, though a 2005 article in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025214212/http:/articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/01/local/me-dean1 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Los Angeles Times</a> cited an attending Highway Patrol Officer who recalled the wreckage and position of Dean’s body indicated a speed around 55 mph, not the 90 mph that had been widely reported.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the tragic collision, rumors spread over the years and decades that Dean had not really died but was living a secret, hidden life; that he was a closeted homosexual; that the Porsche in which he was driving on that fateful day was cursed. Alongside such rumors, the myth of Dean — the man and the actor — only grew as the years passed. “An actor must interpret life,” Dean once said. On screens and in photographs he remains forever on the cusp of adulthood, a representation of anti-establishment teenage disillusionment and social estrangement, an enduring representation generations have looked to as an interpretation and projection of their own inner lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwtsCmnKxllJqur3nDnpitoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
