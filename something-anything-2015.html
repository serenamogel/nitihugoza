A pretty, agreeable and slightly introverted woman, Peggy is good at her job and seems a perfect match for successful Mark, until a miscarriage and a casual breach of trust put an end to their union—all within the brisk ten opening minutes of the movie. After losing the baby, Peggy recoils into herself: the Southern middle-class world she took for granted suddenly becomes unfamiliar to her, maybe even slightly repugnant in its focus on possessions and status. An unexpected sympathy note from a high-school friend named Tim (<a href=#>Linds Edwards</a>), a Kentucky-based Trappist monk representing a life choice radically different from her own, pushes Peggy into a new direction. She quits her job in favor of a lesser-paid position at a local library, cancels her phone service and starts looking into the possibility of monastic living. A reunion with Tim complicates matters, as do Mark’s repeated offers of getting back together and trying to start a family once again.</p><p>Far from a standard-issue indie in its basic premise, Harrill’s first outing as a writer/director is very mature in its treatment of a subject from which movies often shy away: the awakening of a religious impulse in a secular, educated adult. Unlike such recruiting posters as the recent “Heaven is For Real” or the 1943 chestnut “The Song of Bernadette”, “Something, Anything” is close in spirit to <a href=#>Fred Zinnemann</a>’s great 1959 “The Nun’s Story”, in which a particular woman’s religious vocation was treated with all the attentiveness and respect one would hope for when dealing with anyone’s sense of purpose in life.</p><p>As for Peggy’s choices, they are mostly met with incredulity or derision by her friends and peers, as if a pay cut and cancelling one’s cellular plan were forms of self-mutilation at the very least. Peggy gradually (if gently) retreats into contemplation, and we are always aware of the social price she’s paying, as in a scene in which her judgmental friends try to push her back into Mark’s arms (it is a testament to Harrill’s humane touch that the friends are never shown as bullies). At one point, Peggy reveals that she used to be a competitive cheerleader, and there is indeed something of a cheerleader’s poise and diligence about her. It’s there even in the religious pursuit we witness: the subtle humor of “Something, Anything” comes from the fact that Peggy is loaning out books and making notes on the nature of prayer almost as if she were preparing for some spiritual baton-twirling marathon. She cannot help herself; her seriousness about her choices is her armor (and one much more lasting than the blood-red nail polish we see her apply in the first shots of the film, when she still defines herself by other people’s perception of who she is).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46spqadpJ22r7OMmqWyrJieu6h5kWlobg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
