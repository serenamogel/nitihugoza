didn’t go unnoticed by fans or cosmetic surgery experts.</p><p>“He didn’t look bad before, but his face, instead of looking soft and a little bit chubby, it looks model-ish and rugged,” celebrity plastic surgeon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ramtin Kassir,</a> who has worked on the likes of Melissa Gorga and Lele Pons, tells us exclusively.</p><p>Florida-based plastic surgeon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Thomas Su </a>adds, “He definitely has a more masculine look with sharper chiseled facial features compared to how he looked previously.”</p><p>Pamela Weinberger, founding injector <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">at Plump Cosmetics</a>, agrees, “His new look is definitely sharper than it was in the past and has a bit of a ‘wow factor’ for sure with how different his facial structure is looking.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Cosmetic surgery experts tell Page Six exclusively that Liam Payne’s new look is likely due to buccal fat pad removal. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Board-certified plastic surgeon Dr. Kassir says the singer looks “model-ish and rugged” now. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>The experts we spoke to, who have decades of experience combined but have not worked on Payne, agree it appears the former One Direction member may have turned to fillers or the <a href=#>celebrity-favorite buccal fat removal procedure</a> to achieve his sharp features.</p><p>Weinberger says the “What Makes You Beautiful” singer, 29, may have opted for jawline filler, lip filler, chin filler, and regular maintenance Botox.</p><p>Kassir notes that the fillers could have been used to contour the singer’s jaw and chin.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Expert Pamela Weinberger adds that Payne may have gotten filler in his jaw line, chin and cheeks. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Azza Halim</a>, a board-certified multi-specialist physician, says she doesn’t think that fillers alone could help Payne achieve such a defined look in the lower part of his face, so she agrees that buccal fat removal likely played a role.</p><p>Meanwhile, Su points out that perhaps Payne underwent either chin and jawline liposuction, which could also help achieve a sharper jaw line.</p><p>All of the experts we spoke to, though, believe buccal fat removal is the most likely procedure that was used, which we’re told can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 depending on the individual who is performing the cosmetic method.</p><p>However, Kassir warns against those seeking to jump on this new cosmetics “craze” because not all people are the right candidates.</p><p>“You can cause premature aging by just randomly taking out people’s buccal fat,” the New York and New Jersey-based doctor points out.</p><p>Kassir says the best candidates for buccal fat pad removal are those who are generally fit, have a good diet, exercise plan and weight control, but their face is round, so “no matter what they do, their face is full.”</p><p>“If you do it on somebody who’s skinny, as soon as they hit their 30s and maybe even early 40s, their face will look hollow and gaunt and aged,” he says.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Payne has not confirmed whether he’s gone under the knife or used injections to achieve his new appearance. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p><strong>For more Page Six you love …</strong></p><p>Kassir and Halim note that buccal fat removal is not reversible, and while Su and Weinberger agree — for the most part — they say there are alternatives that could be attempted to return the facial structure back to it’s natural look, but it’s not a guarantee.</p><p>“A buccal fat pad removal could potentially be reversed with fat transfer,” Su, who specializes in liposuction and body contouring, says.</p><p>Weinberger, a national trainer for Allergan Medical Institute, adds, “You could attempt to replace back the fat with a collagen induction agent like Sculptra or a hyaluronic acid filler — some fullness in the face is really lovely because it keeps us all youthful.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Dr. Kassir believes Payne’s new look may also be due to weight loss. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Kassir concludes that although Payne’s altered face has opened the floor for speculation, his results could have been achieved by natural causes — or the <a href=#>popular diabetes drug Ozempic</a>, which is commonly used for weight loss by Hollywood’s elite.</p><p>“He looks like he’s lost weight, so that [chiseled look] can happen if they lose a decent amount of weight or if they use insulin or diabetic medicines like Ozempic,” the plastic surgeon says.</p><p>“It leans out your face a lot more than the rest of your body once you lose weight, so he could have theoretically done that, but even if he went to the gym and lost 20 pounds, his face could get tremendously better and more chiseled.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The doctor says the pop star used to have more “soft” look. <span class=credit>Getty Images for BFI</span></figure><p>Kassir notes, though, “I’m not saying he has [taken Ozempic].</p><p>While Payne has not confirmed himself what he’s had done — if anything at all — people on social media appear upset that the “Night Changes” singer no longer looks the same.</p><p>“Omggggggg what happened to Liam?” one person&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">commented under an Instagram post</a>&nbsp;of Payne at Louis Tomlinson’s “All of Those Voices” documentary premiere in London.</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan tweeted,</a> “liam payne’s buccal fat removal makes me so uncomfortable idk that man.”</p><p class=postsid
