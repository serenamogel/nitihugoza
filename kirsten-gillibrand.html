In 2006, Gillibrand won a House of Representatives seat as a Democrat in a traditionally Republican region. She was appointed to the Senate in 2009 after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/hillary-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hillary Clinton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Hillary Clinton</a> resigned. Gillibrand won the seat in 2010 and once again achieved victory in a 2012 reelection. She went on to release the non-fiction work Off the Sidelines and solidified her place as a staunch proponent of reform in the military's handling of sexual assaults. Gillibrand was among the first Democrats to announce her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election, before dropping out of the race in August 2019.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Early Family Life and Schooling</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kirsten Gillibrand was born Kirsten Elizabeth Rutnik on December 9, 1966, in Albany, New York, and grew up in a political household with women who were independent and free thinkers. Her maternal grandmother, Dorothea "Polly" Noonan, had a major influence on Albany politics, advising Mayor Erastus Corning II and organizing state legislature secretaries to political action. Kirsten's mother, Polly Noonan Rutnik, pursued a career in law and also became a black belt in karate. Her father, Douglas Rutnik, worked as a lawyer and lobbyist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gillibrand, who grew up using the nickname "Tina," attended the all-girl prep school Emma Willard before going to Dartmouth College, where she faced a still sexist atmosphere a decade after the ivy-league institution had gone coed. She majored in Asian studies and went abroad to China, where she interviewed the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/dalai-lama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dalai Lama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Dalai Lama</a>. Gillibrand graduated magna cum laude and went on to earn a degree from the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. She worked for a legal firm before entering the world of politics, inspired by the words of Hillary Clinton. During her time as a corporate attorney, she also served as special counsel to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kirsten Rutnik took on the surname Gillibrand after marrying British venture capitalist Jonathan Gillibrand in 2001. They have two children.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">The House, Then Senate</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2006, Gillibrand campaigned for a seat on the House of Representatives, running on a Democratic ticket against Republican incumbent John E. Sweeney for an area of upstate New York that tended to vote Republican. She won the election and cemented her standing with community-based campaigning, which resulted in a 2008 reelection landslide.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gillibrand resigned from her House seat in January 2009. She was appointed by then New York Governor David Paterson to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Clinton, who accepted the position of secretary of state as part of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">President Barack Obama</a>’s newly formed cabinet. Gillibrand won reelection in a special 2010 vote, thus becoming the youngest elected member of the Senate at age 43.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Progressive and Conservative Politics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gillibrand's record has caused her to be described as both progressive and centrist in her political leanings. She has been a major supporter of gay rights, advocating same-sex marriage and the repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, thereby allowing gay citizens to serve openly in the military. She has also worked for women's rights, improved healthcare benefits for 9/11 workers and served on the Senate Agricultural Committee, where she’s fought against food stamp reductions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the conservative end, during her time in the House Gillibrand opposed amnesty for illegal immigrants and received major endorsements from the National Rifle Association. As a senator, she later softened her stance on immigration and started to favor gun control. Gillibrand is also known to favor transparency; in her "Sunlight Report," she openly publishes whom she meets with politically—a decision that has not always been welcomed by colleagues.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Call for Reform in Cases of Sexual Assault</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Up for reelection in 2012, Gillibrand faced off against Republican Wendy Long, who had also attended Dartmouth College. Gillibrand won the race, hence retaining her senate seat. She has since made headlines for seeking to create reform and change around the handling of sexual assaults within the military. Gillibrand has specifically called for commanders to no longer supervise related court-martial proceedings, as military rape cases are handled outside of the purview of the general U.S. judicial system. In March 2014, the Military Justice Improvement Act was supported by 55 senators in a bipartisan show of force, but the numbers weren't sufficient to overcome a filibuster. She has since called for another vote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The following year, Gillibrand and a group of senators proposed the Campus Accountability & Safety Act, which aims to decrease incidents of sexual assault and provide more thorough regulations for how cases are handled at colleges and universities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2014, Gillibrand released the bestselling non-fiction work Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World, which recounts her political ascension and offers her perspective on governmental affairs. Gillibrand was also a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the U.S. presidency in 2016, prior to her loss to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Donald Trump</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Voice of Morality</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In late 2017, Gillibrand began speaking out about the sexual harassment charges that were enveloping major figures in entertainment and politics. In November, she said that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/bill-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Bill Clinton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">President Bill Clinton</a> should have resigned after admitting to his affairs with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/monica-lewinsky data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Monica Lewinsky" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Monica Lewinsky</a>, angering her former allies in the Clinton camp. In December, she was the first Democrat to call on Minnesota Senator Al Franken to step down, following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Enough is enough," she wrote on Facebook. "I believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn’t acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><br tml-linebreak=true>Shortly afterward, Gillibrand was among the growing chorus calling for President Trump to also resign over sexual harassment allegations. True to form, Trump punched back via Twitter, calling the senator a "lightweight and a "flunky" who would "come to my office 'begging' for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them)."<br tml-linebreak=true></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gillibrand later criticized Congressional leaders for dropping anti-sexual harassment measures from an omnibus spending bill, signed into law on March 23. The measures aimed to overhaul what some on both sides of the aisle saw as an outdated policy of harassment claims on Capitol Hill.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am appalled that House and Senate leadership removed provisions from the omnibus bill at the last minute that would have finally brought accountability and transparency to Congress's sexual harassment reporting process,” she said. “It begs the question: Who are they trying to protect?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On March 29, Gillibrand and her 21 female Senate colleagues presented a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in which they called for legislation for a new sexual harassment complaint process on Capitol Hill.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Survivors who have bravely come forward to share their stories have brought to light just how widespread harassment and discrimination continue to be throughout Capitol Hill," they wrote. "No longer can we allow the perpetrators of these crimes to hide behind a 23-year-old law"—the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">2020 Presidential Candidate</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Appearing on The Late Show with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/stephen-colbert data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen Colbert" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Stephen Colbert</a> on January 15, 2019, Gillibrand declared that she was launching an exploratory committee to run for the White House in 2020. "I'm going to run for president of the United States because as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own," she told Colbert.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite her high-profile launch, Gillibrand's candidacy failed to gain significant traction in the months ahead, leaving her well behind frontrunners <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/joe-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe Biden" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Joe Biden</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/elizabeth-warren data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Warren" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/kamala-harris data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kamala Harris" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Kamala Harris</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/bernie-sanders data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bernie Sanders" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Bernie Sanders</a> at the time of the first Democratic debate in late June.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On August 28, 2019, after failing to qualify for the third Democratic debate, Gillibrand announced that she was dropping out of the presidential race.</p><ul data-node-id=37 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Name: Kirsten Gillibrand</li><li>Birth Year: 1966</li><li>Birth date: December 9, 1966</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: Albany</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Kirsten Gillibrand is a U.S. lawyer and politician from New York who's served in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>U.S. Politics</li><li>Politics and Government</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Dartmouth College</li><li>University of California, Los Angeles</li></ul><li>Occupations</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>U.S. Senator</li><li>U.S. Representative</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=40><ul data-node-id=42 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Article Title: Kirsten Gillibrand Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/political-figures/kirsten-gillibrand</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 12, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=45 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>My mother is an amazing woman. She is extremely strong, extremely independent, and she doesn't mind being different.</li><li>One of my mother’s friends’ partners died of AIDS early on, and that affected me. This man was so interesting, so engaging, was always superkind to me. One of the most handsome men I’d ever met. And it was just such a loss for a young girl to see someone die so young.</li><li>More women [in Congress] means more diverse views that represent a wider swath of the electorate. Women bring different experiences and perspectives to bear on decision making, so I truly believe that as more women are elected, the better the outcomes will be for everyone.</li><li>I was a slightly straighter arrow than my mother. OK, I was a massive kiss-ass and lived for positive reinforcement."</li><li>Look at sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. What you see is institutions propping up the favored person, the favored star, the favored student. They close ranks to protect the status quo, and in the process, they victim-blame and undermine the people who are trying to speak truth to power.</li><li>Dream big. Embrace your ambitions. And don’t be afraid of them just because they’re different, or because no one’s done it that way before. It might be a great goal for you.</li><li>I would agree that Congress is broken. You need to have it represent the actual population, so we need to have more women in Congress—we need more consensus-builders, we need people who will listen more, who are less ego-driven and partisan. I really believe if you had 51 percent women in Congress, the whole dynamic would change.</li><li>My whole analysis of 'having it all' is a frustration with the frame, that women should somehow be judged, that they want something they are not supposed to be having, first of all, or that they are having something as opposed to doing something. Because we do 'do it all.' We provide for our children, we go to work every day, we are loving mothers, we do all of that because it is part of who we are, and for a lot of us, we must do that.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvKoqmsrJWjeqi1y6Wgm6qRo7E%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
