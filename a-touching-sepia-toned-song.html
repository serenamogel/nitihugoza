(Unova Neo Champion) (Pokémon Masters EX Version). In addition, a special voice-over line of Nate or Rosa saying "Pokémon Masters EX" would play as soon as the game's logo appeared on the title screen. However, when players updated to version 2.40.0 (released on December 26, 2023), the music and artwork returned to normal, though Nate or Rosa's special voice-over line still played until January 12, 2024.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Plot>Plot</span></h2><p>While <a href=# title="Nate (Masters)">Nate</a> is competing in the Neo Champion Stadium, <a href=# title="Rosa (Masters)">Rosa</a>'s <a href=# title="Meloetta (Pokémon)">Meloetta</a> is practicing its singing in a cave with Rosa and <a href=# title="Hugh (Masters)">Hugh</a> watching. Hugh and Rosa think it's ready to sing in front of a crowd, but Meloetta isn't feeling confident enough yet. Rosa wants to help Meloetta feel more confident, but Hugh recommends that they take it easy for the rest of the day so they don't push themselves too hard and get sick. The pair head back to town, where they learn that Nate has just been announced as Pasio's latest Neo Champion. After the announcement, <a href=# title="Colress (Masters)">Colress</a> and <a href=# title="Iris (Masters)">Iris</a> comment that the power to touch the hearts of others can be expressed in many ways, not just through Pokémon battles. So, Iris announces that they'll be holding a second part of this Neo Champion Stadium. Lear is annoyed that Iris and Colress did this without consulting him, but he allows them to go through with it. Iris explains that like in the first part, <a href=# title="Sync pair">sync pairs</a> will need to be nominated in order to participate, but this time they'll be judged on a performance that they give instead of their battling skills.</p><p>A few days later, Rosa and Meloetta have been nominated by Hugh, <a href=# title="Cheren (Masters)">Cheren</a>, and <a href=# title="Bianca (Masters)">Bianca</a>, and they're both nervous about it. However, Rosa really wants to live up to everyone's expectations, so she starts trying to come up with a plan for their performance. Suddenly, they're approach <a href=# title="Lisia (Masters)">Lisia</a> and <a href=# title="Dawn (Masters)">Dawn</a>, whom Hugh brought there to help Rosa with her performance. Rosa introduces them to Meloetta and asks it to show off what they've been practicing. Meloetta performs its <a href=# title="Relic Song (move)">Relic Song</a>, transforming into <a href=# title="List of Pokémon with form differences">Pirouette Forme</a> and then back to Aria Forme. Dawn and Lisia are impressed, and Dawn asks Rosa if she's going to sing or dance alongside Meloetta. Rosa admits she hasn't decided yet because she's not good at singing or dancing, and Dawn assures her that she can do anything as long as she's with Meloetta. Lisia suggests that she express her feelings in her own way, which gives Rosa the idea to do a performance that combines singing, dancing, and acting - a musical. She runs off to start preparing, and Hugh thanks Dawn and Lisia for their help before following Rosa. Dawn says she's glad that they were able to help Rosa, but they just cheered on the person they're going to be competing against.</p><p>Later, Rosa and Meloetta are practicing their show by the fountain in town when one of the audience members turns away after being disappointed by Meloetta's performance, which discourages Meloetta. Rosa tells everyone that she and Meloetta will be participating in the upcoming Neo Champion Stadium, and that they want to show everyone how wonderful their home region <a href=# title=Unova>Unova</a> is through their performance. She says that she feels like she can accomplish anything with Meloetta by her side, which gets the crowd fired up and cheers Meloetta up. Hugh, who has been watching the performance, is satisfied that they're going to be OK. However, unbeknownst to Hugh, Rosa is developing a cough.</p><p>The day of the Neo Champion Stadium arrives, and all the participants take turns performing for the judges. Rosa and Meloetta's turn finally arrives, and Cheren and Bianca are nervous, but Hugh is confident that they can do it. Rosa announces that she and Meloetta are going to perform a musical to show their love for Unova, but as the music starts and she starts to sing, all that comes out is a cough. Rosa realizes she lost her voice, and a clamor rises from the crowd as Rosa continues to stand there without doing anything. However, having taken Dawn's advice to heart, Rosa thinks to herself that she'll be OK as long as she's with Meloetta, and she and Meloetta begin to dance together. Dawn and Lisia watch the performance in awe, and Colress notes that the numbers are rising on his machine. Iris says that she can feel Rosa and Meloetta's love for Unova even without words. Hugh comments that Rosa always tries her hardest to make people smile, and Cheren and Bianca agree that she's accomplishing that.</p><p>That evening, Iris announces Rosa as the winner of the Neo Champion Stadium and invites her to come out, wearing her Champion outfit. Rosa says that her voice is feeling better because she got to rest for a bit, and then Nate comes out, also wearing his Champion outfit. Rosa congratulates him on becoming Neo Champion, as she never got to congratulate him after he first earned the title. Nate is happy to hear that, and he congratulates her on becoming Neo Champion, too. The crowd cheers as the two new Neo Champions smile at each other.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Area_info>Area info</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Battles>Battles</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Event_missions>Event missions</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Shop>Shop</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Gallery>Gallery</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Music>Music</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Script>Script</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_other_languages>In other languages</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Notes>Notes</span></h2><li id=cite_note-1><span class=mw-cite-backlink><a href=#>↑</a></span> <span class=reference-text>Unlocks 70 HP, 60 Attack, 20 Defense, 60 Sp.
