After all, even retired players have loads of cash, right? Perhaps. But as <a href=# rel=noopener>RBA Wealth Management</a> says, the average NFL player retires before the age of 28 — when lots of folks are just starting to figure their careers out, if that. There’s a lot of life left after that, plenty of opportunity for financial and health-related calamity, and a long time to stretch NFL salaries, no matter how high.&nbsp;</p><p>On that note, Fast Company points to two charities, in particular, that receive NFL fine money and help support former players:&nbsp;Gene Upshaw Player Assistance Trust (P.A.T.) Fund and the&nbsp;NFL Player Care Foundation. The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Gene Upshaw P.A.T. Fund</a>&nbsp;website says it helps players with, “unforeseen events or crisis, unaffordable medical situations, and players whose lack of college degree or certification is keeping them from financial stability.” By the looks of the site, former players have to apply for assistance. Similarly, the <a href=# rel=noopener>NFL Player Care Foundation</a> website is “dedicated to helping retired players improve their quality of life” and “addresses all aspects of life by providing programs and assistance with medical, emotional, financial, social, and community issues.” At the time of writing, they’ve received $21.6 million in aid and helped 2,102 players.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZuupMCOsJ%2BeqpVisbCx0maroZ1doryvsdhmnqhlp52yr3nAp2Snnpxiva2t2J6pZqGjYrOqusSdZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
