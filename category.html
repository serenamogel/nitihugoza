Our kiddo loves fresh fruit, so I’ve been getting all kinds at the farmers market this summer. Peaches, cherries, blueberries… Every type has been delicious, but I’ve been especially impressed by the fresh blackberries. They’re soft, juicy, and sweet. In past summers, I’ve definitely under-appreciated this wonderful fruit! To spread the blackberry love, I’m sharing my easy blackberry crisp recipe. The fresh berries bake into a tart, jammy filling, which I top with an oat crumble that gets beautifully golden brown and toasty in the oven. This vegan and gluten-free dessert is wonderful on…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Fresh tomato recipes go on repeat in our house every summer. In the dead of winter, there’s nothing I crave more than a summer tomato—sweet, juicy, and ripe. The out-of-season supermarket ones can’t compare, so when summer rolls around, I only have a few months to make every tomato salad, sandwich, pasta, and pizza I’ve imagined throughout the year. When I made my grocery list this morning, I added cherry tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, and&nbsp;tomatoes on the vine. We have lots of tomato recipes on tap this week. 🙂 I hope you’re also cooking with tomatoes like crazy right now, while…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Are you team salsa roja or salsa verde? I’m team…both! I adore all types of salsa made with fresh ingredients, and this salsa roja recipe is one I’ve been especially loving lately. It differs from other red salsas I’ve previously shared in two ways: I roast the fresh ingredients.&nbsp;Charring the tomatoes, onion, and serrano peppers adds smoky depth of flavor to this salsa recipe. I use a dried chile.&nbsp;It thickens the salsa, adds rich complexity, and brings out the smoky flavor even more. If you try this salsa roja, you won’t believe it’s homemade. It tastes like you could have…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This fattoush salad recipe is the perfect side dish for a summer meal. A Middle Eastern staple, fattoush is fresh and bright, featuring seasonal vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and lettuce, plus a hefty dose of parsley and mint. But, as tasty as tomatoes are in August, the star ingredient in fattoush isn’t a vegetable. It’s bread! That’s right—crispy pita bread adds crunch to this salad, making it pretty darn irresistible for just about anyone. (Salad skeptics, I’m looking at you.) I hope you try this recipe. I think you’ll love it!

These sweet, bursty berries are so tasty that we eat most of them plain, but I always try to save enough for a loaf of this delicious quick bread too. It’s moist, tender, and loaded with berries, and plenty of lemon zest gives it a pop of bright flavor. Enjoyed alongside a cup of coffee or tea, a slice of this lemon blueberry bread is the perfect light breakfast. For a sweeter treat, drizzle it with a simple lemon…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When summer sweet corn comes hits peak season, this elote recipe goes on repeat in our house. I love corn on the cob in all its iterations, but something about elote is especially irresistible. This grilled Mexican street corn is creamy, tangy, sweet, and smoky. If you’ve never tried it—or never tried making it at home—now’s the time. Let’s make it! Elote Recipe Ingredients Here’s what you’ll need to make this elote recipe: Fresh sweet corn, of course! Use the freshest corn on the cob you can find. Mayonnaise – It creates a creamy coating for the corn and helps…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Meet my go-to iced matcha latte recipe! I make this energizing drink just about every day from the start of summer to when the temps dip in the fall. It’s cool and creamy, with a slightly grassy, earthy flavor that I absolutely love. Matcha took off in popularity in the US a few years back, and these days, you can find an iced matcha latte on almost any coffee shop menu. I still order one out from time to time, but for the most part, I prefer to make my own iced matcha latte at home. Here’s why: I can…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s zucchini season! Bring on the zucchini recipes! Partway through July every summer, I start to feel like I’ve cooked all the zucchini recipes out there. I’ve made zucchini bread and zucchini fritters, grilled zucchini and baked zucchini chips. This week, I looked at my market haul of summer squash and asked, “What next?”. If you’re in a similar spot right now, I have good news: zucchini is one versatile veggie. It tastes fantastic in pastas, tacos, salads, and even chocolate cake! You can grill it, bake it, sauté it, and also eat it raw. We might feel like we’ve…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This zucchini fritters recipe is the perfect thing to make when you have a surplus of summer squash in the fridge. It calls for a full pound of zucchini, about 3 medium. But it’s so tasty that if you happen to have even more&nbsp;zucchini than that on hand (and at this time of year, you might), you probably won’t mind making it again and polishing off another batch of zucchini fritters the next day. These zucchini fritters are crispy on the outside and light and tender in the middle. Lemon zest makes them nice and bright, while scallions, garlic, and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This zucchini smoothie tastes like a chocolate milkshake. It’s creamy, rich, and sweet. Even though it’s healthy enough to drink for breakfast or a snack, it could totally pass for dessert. It’s that good! Zucchini Smoothie Recipe Ingredients Ready to try this chocolate zucchini smoothie recipe? Here’s what you’ll need: Zucchini, of course! You’ll need one medium. Chop and freeze it at least a day before you plan to make the smoothie. Medjool dates – For sweetness. Almond butter – It adds protein and healthy fats.

It’s super moist, warmly spiced, studded with crunchy walnuts, and PACKED with shredded zucchini, so you can use up a good portion of your summer squash haul in one go. If there’s something else you look for in a zucchini bread recipe, let me know, but to me, this one is perfection. I love that all the ingredients are pantry basics, that the batter is a breeze to stir together, and that the recipe yields two loaves.
