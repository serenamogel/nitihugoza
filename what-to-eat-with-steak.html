You made the decision to spend your hard-earned cash on a beautiful hunk of prime steak. But now what? What does one get to go with steak that’s more interesting than just potatoes and broccoli? Well, if there’s one thing I know, it’s that if you’re spending a chunk of money on a steak dinner, you want it to be nice, so here are some nice, sophisticated things that could solve the conundrum of what to eat with steak.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

If you are feeling lost and wondering what to eat with steak, look no further than these Take & Bake Rolls from La Brea Bakery. Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo called these a “restaurant quality, chewy, savory, yeasty French roll.” These are soft and squishy with a fantastic crust, and if that’s not sophisticated enough for steak, I don’t know what is.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Dinner Rolls: The 6 Best for Your Thanksgiving Feast</a></strong></p><p>Say what you will about Walmart (and I’m aware there’s a LOT to say), but they make a damn fine steak sauce. Dare I say, the best steak sauce (at least that the Sporked team tried during their steak sauce taste test). Senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> noted its tongue-watering tang, and Danny added that it has “notes like tomato puree, vinegar, spices, raisin puree, and orange puree, but it’s just so damn savory.” Plus, it’s one dollar. Yes, for a whole bottle! Mr. Mart (first name Wal, who I assume runs Walmart) is practically paying you to buy it.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Steak Sauce: 7 Best Steak Sauces You Can Buy</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Green Giant Simply Steam Creamed Spinach Sauced</strong></a><p>This stuff is an everyday staple in my humble li’l freezer but that doesn’t mean it tastes “everyday” or “humble.” Nah, this stuff is downright decadent. Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling </a>described this one as “creamy” and “savory,” saying, “There’s actual spinach in there—real leaves with real bite to them. It even has that touch of bitter astringency that spinach has, which helps balance out the richness.” In other words, this stuff gets close to the platonic ideal of creamed spinach. And while I think it would be absolutely fabulous alongside (or even on top of) a nice steak, it’s also good on its own and you should definitely try this.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Frozen Creamed Spinach: Sidle Up to the 5 Best Frozen Creamed Spinach Brands</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Vermont Creamery Cultured Butter with Sea Salt</strong></a><p>I’m sure you’ve seen people in online videos relentlessly dousing their steaks in butter (often a compound butter, which is butter with things such as garlic and herbs mixed into it), both in the pan and on the plate. If you are going to flavor your steak this way, why not use the most savory, complex butter possible? This Vermont Creamery butter has great depth of flavor, and Sporked managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> noted that “this butter takes you on a journey to butter town.” If that’s true, I’d like a ticket for one, please!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Butter: No Buts About the 7 Best Butters (Salted & Unsalted)</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Honey Dijon Kettle Chips</strong></a><p>Wondering what to eat with steaks? Thinking of maybe finding something ~fancy~? That’s all well and good, but sometimes you just want chips with your steak. Maybe it’s been a long day, maybe you want all the foods you love at once, heck, maybe you just like your steak fries eeeeeextra crispy. Well, we can honestly and conclusively say that Honey Dijon is the best flavor of Kettle brand chips. Danny pointed out that these chips are “so sweet, tangy, and mustardy,” and that the flavor is, “almost caramelized—it’s powerfully rich and deliciously savory.” These chips really do bring the salt, fat, acid, and heat. So call up your best friend and legendary food writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Samin Nosrat</a>, grab a steak and some of these chips, and have a partay!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 10 Best Kettle Chip Flavors, an Extra-Crunchy Ranking</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lamb Weston Grown in Idaho Hand Cut Style Fries</strong></a><p>Looking for what to eat steak with? There’s a reason steak fries exist as a concept (at least I think they are called that because they go with steak and not because they are so big they are practically li’l steaks themselves). Hearty fries simply go well with steak. That being said, these fries are not steak fries. Am I fazed by this? Nah, dawg. Who cares what type of fries you have with your steak as long as they are crispy, greasy, and salty, and, boy, do these fries tick those boxes. And not only are these fries “well-seasoned, crispy, and fatty,” they are simply fantastic – “creamy on the inside, crispy on the outside.” A symphony of textures, if you will. And I will.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>It’s the 7 Best Frozen French Fries</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mnJqsXay2tbSMrKuemZtk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
