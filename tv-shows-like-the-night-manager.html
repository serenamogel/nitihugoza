Of course, now that the actor has achieved international acclaim for his portrayal of Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he has solidified his acting abilities by drawing on his significant theater experience. Hiddleston’s announcement that he would be entering the world of television sparked a lot of excitement among his admirers.</p><p>The show in dispute is BBC One’s ‘The Night Manager,’ which is based on acclaimed novelist John le Carre’s novel of the same name. Hiddleston plays the role of Johnathan Pine, a former soldier who now works as a night manager in a posh hotel. Pine’s world is turned upside down when an intelligence official contacts him about taking on a case of international espionage. Pine will need to employ all of the skills he acquired during his years in the military if he is to complete the assignment successfully.</p><p>Espionage novels have always been a popular genre of fiction, and le Carre is the undisputed king of it. Many of his works have been adapted for the big screen and the little screen. Suspense, deception, and danger are hallmarks of le Carre’s tales, and this is exactly where Johnathan Pine finds himself while attempting to execute his task. During its six-episode first season, ‘The Night Manager’ gained considerable critical praise and even won a number of accolades. The show won three Golden Globes for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Tom Hiddleston), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Olivia Colman), and Best Supporting Actor (Tom Hiddleston) (Hugh Laurie). You’ve come to the correct place if you’re seeking for shows that are similar to ‘The Night Manager.’ Here’s a list of TV shows that are similar to “The Night Manager,” some of which are available on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h3>A Perfect Spy (1987)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/A-Perfect-Spy.jpg alt="the night manager,the night manager cast,shows like the night manager reddit,the night manager season 2,best mini series,best series to watch,shows like the night manager,more shows like the night manager,best shows like the night manager,shows or movies like the night manager,best tv series like the night manager,most popular night show,tv shows like the night manager,night manager summary,shows if you like the night manager" width=1022 height=772 sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>This is yet another John le Carre novel that was turned into a BBC television miniseries in 1987. Magnus Pym, the principal character, begins his career as a spy for the British Secret Service when he is very young. Magnus is heavily impacted by his father during his early years, when he is taken to different robbery and black marketeering operations by his father. Magnus is shaped into a steely warrior with a distinct personality as a result of these odd circumstances.</p><p>Magnus’ formative years and out-of-this-world experiences come in handy during his MI6 days. The novel used a stream of consciousness approach as a narrative device to investigate the psychology of the protagonist, whose actions are constantly psychologically complicated and multilayered. The series’ narrative differs from the novel’s, which might be considered a huge setback in the storytelling process. The work is structured in such a way that it alternates between the protagonist’s childhood stories and his current circumstances in order to convey his current state of mind.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uabdfa2d2872ab8631b45b246be980eaf><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Highest Rated TV Shows Of 2022 On IMDb</span></a><h3>Babylon Berlin (2017-)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Babylon-Berlin.jpg alt="the night manager,the night manager cast,shows like the night manager reddit,the night manager season 2,best mini series,best series to watch,shows like the night manager,more shows like the night manager,best shows like the night manager,shows or movies like the night manager,best tv series like the night manager,most popular night show,tv shows like the night manager,night manager summary,shows if you like the night manager" width=960 height=540 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Babylon Berlin’ isn’t precisely a spy series, but its placement in this list feels extremely appropriate for a variety of reasons. To begin with, the series takes place in a world populated by people who have secrets to keep hidden. None of the characters can be classified as good or bad because they all exist somewhere in the middle, with their own hidden intentions. Second, it’s a scenario in which the protagonist is pushed outside of his or her comfort zone to execute a very perilous assignment that is also potentially life-threatening.</p><p>The protagonist of ‘Babylon Berlin’ is Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), a police investigator dispatched from Cologne to Berlin to investigate the city’s expanding illegal pornography sector. However, there is a far greater threat on the horizon, which quickly becomes apparent to our main characters and begins to play a significant role in the plot. In its plot, cinematography, and presentation, ‘Babylon Berlin’ heavily employs neo-noir themes. The use of light and shadow is an important component of film noir aesthetics, and this fits in perfectly with ‘Babylon Berlin,’ as the show’s setting is a city where everyone has a shadowy side. As a result, the cinematography perfectly suits the tale.</p><h3>Deutschland 83 (2015)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Deutschland-83.jpg alt="the night manager,the night manager cast,shows like the night manager reddit,the night manager season 2,best mini series,best series to watch,shows like the night manager,more shows like the night manager,best shows like the night manager,shows or movies like the night manager,best tv series like the night manager,most popular night show,tv shows like the night manager,night manager summary,shows if you like the night manager" width=1000 height=594 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Deutschland 83’ is the idea of Anna Winger, an American author and journalist, and her husband, Joerg. The plot revolves around the armed forces stationed on either side of the Berlin Wall to prevent anyone from crossing over during the volatile years when the Berlin Wall divided Germany into pro-US and pro-Soviet factions. The plot revolves around Martin Rauch, an East German border patrol guard who is suddenly assigned the extremely risky task of crossing to West Germany dressed as one of their soldiers in order to learn about NATO secrets and pass them on to his superiors.</p><p>The plot follows Rauch’s transformation from a minor soldier to a courageous spy who will go to any length to complete his mission. The inclusion of ‘Deutschland 83’ on this list is due to the fact that the universe in which the story is situated is strikingly similar to that of le Carre’s books. Everyone has a secret of their own, and no one is who they seem to be. The order of the day is lies and deception. In such a world, we meet our protagonist, who must now navigate all of these hazards while remaining true to his objective. The series went on to win awards for its realistic portrayal of political and social problems surrounding the Berlin Wall. In addition, the series won the International Emmy Award for Best Drama Series.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u718628aed3b1fe0056292e3f09de76a5><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Best Shows On Netflix Right Now - January 2023</span></a><h3>The Bodyguard (2018-)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Bodyguard.jpg alt="the night manager,the night manager cast,shows like the night manager reddit,the night manager season 2,best mini series,best series to watch,shows like the night manager,more shows like the night manager,best shows like the night manager,shows or movies like the night manager,best tv series like the night manager,most popular night show,tv shows like the night manager,night manager summary,shows if you like the night manager" width=700 height=422 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘The Bodyguard,’ created and written by Jed Mercurio, is a story about a former British soldier who now works for London’s Metropolitan Police Service’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Branch. Our main character, Police Sergeant David Budd, is required to work as a full-time security guard for the country’s Home Minister as part of one of his tasks. Budd dislikes the policies promoted by the politician in question, yet he never lets his personal convictions get in the way of his job. Julia Montague, the politician in question, wants to impose laws that require the people of England to give up personal information and privacy in the name of security.</p><p>Many individuals are willing to go to any length to stop her. Budd is more than just an army veteran who does his job well. He also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and this facet of his personality is crucial to the plot of the drama. While being a tension-filled action-thriller series, ‘The Bodyguard’ highlights crucial themes regarding privacy and mental anguish. Both Johnathan Pine in ‘The Night Manager’ and David Budd in ‘The Bodyguard’ are army veterans who have settled into civilian life. Because their perspectives on society are so similar, ‘The Bodyguard’ has earned a spot on this list.</p><h3>The Little Drummer Girl (2018)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Little-Drummer-Girl.jpg alt="the night manager,the night manager cast,shows like the night manager reddit,the night manager season 2,best mini series,best series to watch,shows like the night manager,more shows like the night manager,best shows like the night manager,shows or movies like the night manager,best tv series like the night manager,most popular night show,tv shows like the night manager,night manager summary,shows if you like the night manager" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Another John le Carre novel, ‘The Little Drummer Girl,’ has been adapted for television by Michael Lesslie and Claire Wilson. The story is set in the 1970s and follows Charmian “Charlie” Ross, a young actress who is recruited as a spy by a Mossad operative. The new task is a quantum jump into risk, uncertainty, and death for Charlie, where a single minor error may be lethal.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u8d6ec1662dc6a03541b5f6ed5fff22ff><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What's The Latest Update On The Night Manager Season 2?</span></a><p>As an underlying layer to the primary tale, a wonderfully woven love story unfolds in the dark work of shadows. In the series, renowned actors Michael Shannon and Alexander Skarsgrd, as well as actress Florence Pugh, who plays Charlie, give strong performances. The timing of the narrative is crucial in such stories, and ‘The Little Drummer Girl’ does this wonderfully over the six episodes. The series’ art direction, storyline, and powerful performances were praised by critics.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="the night manager,the night manager cast,shows like the night manager reddit,the night manager season 2,best mini series,best series to watch,shows like the night manager,more shows like the night manager,best shows like the night manager,shows or movies like the night manager,best tv series like the night manager,most popular night show,tv shows like the night manager,night manager summary,shows if you like the night manager" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
