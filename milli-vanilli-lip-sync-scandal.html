Their debut hit “Girl You Know It’s True” was on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/milli-vanilli data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Billboard Hot 100" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Billboard Hot 100</a> for 26 weeks, peaking at No. 2, in April 1989, so joining the inaugural Club MTV Tour alongside Paula Abdul and Tone Loc seemed to be the next logical step to catapult them into fame with live shows.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Performing in front of a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdRrCZ9DDcw" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="crowd of 80,000" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">crowd of 80,000</a> at the theme park Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut, in 1989, the duo of Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus started with their trademark energy and dance moves. But then their famous chorus came — and suddenly the lyrics repeated endlessly through the venue: “Girl you know it’s, girl you know it’s, girl you know it’s…”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The word “true” never came. After all, it wasn’t true. In fact, very little of what Milli Vanilli was about was true at all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I knew right then and there, it was the beginning of the end for Milli Vanilli,” Pilatus told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/116ab3f8b41bd4a96c92d9c54e814812 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Los Angeles Times</a> in November 1990. “When my voice got stuck in the computer and it just kept repeating and repeating, I panicked. I just ran off the stage.″</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even so, after that scandal, the group went on to win three trophies at the American Music Awards in January 1990 and the Grammy for Best New Artist, beating out the Indigo Girls and Tone Loc, the following month.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a time before social media watchdogs and when lip-syncing to live performances was commonplace, Milli Vanilli got away with their ruse for longer than they might have today. But now their name is pretty much synonymous with the biggest lip-syncing scandal in pop culture history.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">"Girl You Know It's True" was already hit before Pilatus and Morvan were cast</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">German record producer Frank Farian was in a disco in his native country when he heard the song “Girl You Know It’s True” by the Baltimore band Numarx — and immediately knew it could be a bigger hit. So he set out to assemble a team to recreate a new version, taking the original hip-hop track and mixing it with a bit of Eurodance, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8551402/milli-vanilli-oral-history-lip-syncing data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Billboard class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Billboard</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He started recruiting singers in 1988 — <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/milli-vanilli-voice-steps-into-the-limelight/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sisters Linda and Jodie Rocco" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">sisters Linda and Jodie Rocco</a> sang backup and Charles Shaw rapped on the track. “When he played the record for me, I already knew the song,” Shaw told Billboard. “I had been dancing to the Numarx version on the weekends in American clubs in Hamburg. Farian played it and I said, ‘This song ain’t new.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shaw says Farian admitted it wasn’t new. But he still went with it and just started mixing voices. “You can’t really hear the vocals or exactly who’s singing, because there are so many voices on the chorus,” he said. Eventually, Brad Howell and John Davis were brought in for vocals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There was no denying that Farian knew what he was doing. His version of the song quickly became popular in Europe. Now he just needed faces to go along with the music group.</p><img alt="Brad Howell (R) & John Davis (2L), who lip-synced for the fakes, w.

He had done the same thing with his 1970s disco-funk group Boney M., with a singer who was actually just a dancer, lip-syncing to Farian’s own vocals. (He was able to hang onto that secret for 25 years, according to Shaw.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Farian came back after the song hit the charts in England and said he had to have two faces for the project,” Shaw continued. “I was already paid $12,000 for doing [“Girl”] and he said, ‘Keep your mouth shut and you can do the whole album.’ I’m thinking, ‘That’s studio work for me.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Had Farian realized how popular the group would become, he may have realized the dancers’ accents — with Pilatus’ mother tongue of German and Morvan’s of French — would be an issue.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Linda and Jodie were also brought back in for more vocals. “There was no real plan… we were just recording stuff real fast, to get enough together for a four-song EP for the American market. Then Frank said Arista was involved and he was talking to Clive Davis,” Linda said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sure enough, soon there was a record deal, so they figured there was a group. But when they got to the studio, it was just Linda, Jodie and another singer, Joan Faulker. “[Pilatus and Morvan] would come in and go down to the basement where the pool was and hang out for a couple hours,” Jodie said. “They’d make appearances, then go down to the basement, but they never sang a note or went into the studio.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Linda said they were kept a distance from the guys so that they wouldn’t get too close.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The real singer was secretly brought in at night</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Somehow they were able to keep up the facade. They were able to keep a music label rep from traveling to Germany by saying they wanted to retain creative direction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It wasn’t out of the question,” the Arista A&R manager at the time, Richard Sweret, told Billboard. “Other producers would do their work and send it in. They just didn’t want anyone in the studio with them because it’s a creative professional distance a producer wants to have. I respected that and there was no reason to think that it was anything other than that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But there was a lot of fishy business going on. Howell would be taken to the studio late at night, even after other staff was gone, so that no one would know he was the true voice. “It was a secret,” the engineer on the album, Tobias Freund, said. “We worked in the evening and closed the windows.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jens Gad, who played guitar and co-wrote several songs, didn’t even cross paths with the faces of the music he was working on: “We never met Rob and Fab, there was no need for them to be in the studio. It was show business: Frank created the scenario where he put this and this and this together, and that was the show. It was completely normal.”</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Pilatus and Morvan were catapulted into stardom</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdSmokR0Enk" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="music video" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">music video</a> for “Girl You Know It’s True” was a global hit and Milli Vanilli also had <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/milli-vanilli/chart-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="four other hit songs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">four other hit songs</a> — “Blame It On the Rain,” “Girl I’m Gonna Miss You” and “Baby Don’t Forget My Number,” which all hit No. 1 and “All or Nothing” which peaked at No. 4. In short, they were everywhere.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And with that, the suspicions started to come. “Every time we gave an interview, the reporters would hear my French accent or Rob’s German accent and they’d say, ’No way. How could these guys have sung the songs?’” Morvan told the Los Angeles Times.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They even had dialect specialists brought in — paid by Arista Records — to try to help the situation. But fast fame didn’t make it easy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">″We didn’t want to do any more interviews,″ Pilatus added. ″The more we talked, the worse things got.″</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Their former Arista product manager, Robert Wieger, recalled the situation to Billboard. “I remember there were some words Fab couldn’t pronounce. He had a pretty thick French/Guadalupan accent, so on ‘Girl I’m Gonna Miss You’ he couldn’t say ‘miss,’ and he said ‘meeees.’"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But fans were in love. The duo did an appearance in Los Angeles where they were mobbed to the point that the cops were brought in. After all, they had the looks, moves and charisma — they were just lacking the vocal talent that it was all built on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having gone through the rags-to-riches rise so quickly, even Pilatus and Morvan got caught up. “Their egos were so big, because they were such big stars, that they were like, ‘We can sing, no problem,” Wieger said. “They became believers in their own false story.”</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Despite being common for musicians to sing to track on tour, a broken single gave away Milli Vanilli's lip-syncing secret</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With that level of confidence, it’s no wonder they were comfortable getting up in front of a live crowd and performing. Plus, in that era, it wasn’t unusual for singers to lip-sync since the live demands of running around a stage could get in the way with vocals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Everyone was singing to track on that tour,” MTV VJ and Club MTV host Downtown Julie Brown told Billboard. “It wasn’t so much about who had the best voice, just as long as you could perform and give the audience exactly what they wanted. They wanted to see you perform and touch you. That was the fun of that whole clubby vibe. Milli Vanilli definitely brought that to them.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But there was already some foreshadowing that this was risky business in front of such big crowds. During a Milwaukee stop of the tour with 22,000 people, Milli Vanilli’s vocals simply didn’t come on. They guys were caught looking like they were ready to start, but with no voices to go along with that. “They ran offstage, punched [their tour manager] in the chest and locked themselves in their tour bus,” former MTV director of on-air talent Steve Leeds added to the Billboard story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I wanted to die,” Pilatus told MTV. “I couldn’t repeat it 15 times, so I stopped, I panicked, I went off stage.” He said Brown went running after him. “I said, ‘I’ve had enough. I quit.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Brown knew what she needed to do: “Backstage it was hell-raising. Rob was so mad. I told him to get open the door, and I just had to talk to him, saying, ‘They’re here to see you perform and you’re doing such a great job — don’t let this stop you from giving fans what they want.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He did get back on stage. And they did finish the show.</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They demanded to sing on their next album</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Oddly, they weathered that 1989 performance and went on to win at the AMAs and Grammys in 1990.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pilatus and Morvan pressed Farian to let them showcase their true vocals and that’s when everything unraveled. “We said to Frank Farian, ‘You don’t let us sing on the album. Don’t do this anymore,’” Pilatus told the Los Angeles Times. ″We don’t want to live like this.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Farian blamed the duo’s cocky attitude while the men blamed Farian for taking advantage of them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eventually, Farian’s statement came out first, saying the guys had set an ultimatum. The guys countered with a press conference, where Pilatus said, ″We were seduced, we were abused and we felt very guilty.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The fallout was large and wide. Arista dropped them and deleted their entire catalog, fans demanded refunds and threatened to sue for fraud and — for the first and only time — their Grammy was revoked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“To lose everything so publicly was harsh,” Morvan said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VLKU4h18EU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oprah Winfrey’s Where Are They Now?" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Oprah Winfrey’s Where Are They Now?</a> “You don’t know where to turn to because there’s nobody around you, you’re left alone. We were famous and now we’re infamous just like that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While he eventually found his way back to EDM music, Pilatus never rebounded. “Rob Pilatus didn't do well with humiliation,” Morvan continued. “Being punched every day in the public eye leaves marks. They only way he could deal with it, for him, was the addiction.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pilatus was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/milli-vanillis-rob-pilatus-dead-at-33-2-243519/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="found dead" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">found dead</a> at 33 in Frankfurt on April 2, 1998, of a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/celebrity-prescription-overdoses/6/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="suspected overdose" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">suspected overdose</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“When I heard the news of Rob’s death, everything went blank at that moment. Silence,” Morvan said. “It was like losing a part of myself. In order to honor him, and for myself, I said a vow that I would do my thing. And I would make sure the name Milli Vanilli itself means when you fall, you stand back up, and you move on.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJopKKknJ56t63NoqOloV2htrF50rKlnGWjmK6vsMCl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
