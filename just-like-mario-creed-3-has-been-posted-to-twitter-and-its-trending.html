The ability to post entire movies is apparently the fault of the little blue checkmark, which allows those that have one to upload longer 1080p videos, up to 92 minutes in fact.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Creed 3 appeared to have only been on Twitter for a very short time, but users who were quick to cotton on to the fact made full use of it.

The film has already had its theatrical run, raking in an impressive $274 million, overtaking both Creed and Creed II. It may be some time before we can expect to see it on streaming services, with it being unclear where we will be able to go to get our hands on it as of right now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooa6rpGK5qrfEZqSaqpmkeqS%2BxJ6bZmtdna60ecGenKdloKTAtbHDZquoZaSstrXAxKtkmqaUYra1v4ytqZ6mlJ67qHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
