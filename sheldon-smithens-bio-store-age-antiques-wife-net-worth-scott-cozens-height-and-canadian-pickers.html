One profession taught him about energy and scientific principle; the other taught him how to sell a line. He’s always been fond of poking through other people’s throwaways and hanging out at garage sales, though. As Antiques Roadshow has shown week in and week out for countless seasons, looking for “old stuff” never gets old. One never truly knows what value there may be in that reupholstered theatre seat or that fading, Depression-era poster that has history stamped all over it.</p><p>Sheldon Smithens, on the other hand, is a third-generation antique dealer. Picking is in his blood. He’s a professional auction broker and appraisal expert, and he lectured at the University of Calgary before Canadian Pickers made him, if not a TV star exactly, a regular TV presence. Smithens taught a course called “Antiques, Art and Auction,” but it didn’t take him long to figure out that doing is more time-consuming than teaching.</p><p>The idea for Canadian Pickers was spawned by American Pickers, but it’s truly Canadian, in every other way. Smithens and Cozens knew each other through their families; their mothers would hang out together at community garage sales. The show’s producers picked Smithens for Canadian Pickers early on, in part because of his appearances on Canadian Antiques Roadshow. Cozens came along for the ride, and because it made sense that the two hosts of Canadian Pickers get along. Having them bicker over finds like a pair of old alley cats might have made for good TV, but only for a short time. Canadian Pickers, now in its fourth year, is in it for the long haul.</p><p>Last season, Cozens and Smithens scored a woolly mammoth tusk and prehistoric bison skulls in the Yukon; bagged themselves a rare Smokey the Bear forest service sign and some vintage hockey seats signed by Montreal Canadiens legend Guy Lafleur in La Belle Province; plucked a collection of vintage guitars in southern Ontario cottage country; and stumbled over a treasure trove of old atlases, antique litho signs, trolley posters, and rare vintage gas pumps while working the B.C. trail between Armstrong, Mission and Abbotsford.</p><p>The upcoming season will include stops in Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario, plus ones in Vancouver Island and Whistler, B.C. The season will also feature a Pickers first, a jaunt across the pond to the U.K., where the show is known as Cash Cowboys.</p><p>Only time will tell what they’re liable to find in the new season. One day they might even find some Vancouver Canucks Stanley Cup Champions memorabilia — though, at this rate, that may take a few more years yet.
