The actor received a swimming scholarship to attend Fordham University. Still, he declined to study Spanish, culture, and community at UCLA, with a minor in film and television. At a young age, Perez began performing, debuting in opera houses with musicals. Then he traveled to Los Angeles and began a career as a model. He used a sheet as a background for his bedroom picture shoots, mailed the results in manila envelopes with self-tapes, and soon appeared in movies and on television.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Today, his charismatic on-screen persona and wide acting range have earned him widespread acclaim and a loyal fanbase. Perez has shown that he is one of Hollywood’s most promising talents by being able to perform in a wide variety of genres and portraying a range of characters, from comedies to dramas. Let’s look at his acting career and rate some of his most compelling performances.</p><h2 id=h-8-minx-2022 data-injectable=false>8.&nbsp;Minx (2022)</h2><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=930 data-injectable=true>Ellen Rapoport is the brains behind the American comedy TV series&nbsp;Minx, which stars Ophelia Lovibond and Jake Johnson. The plot of&nbsp;Minx&nbsp;centers on an aspiring writer named Joyce Prigger (Ophelia Lovibond) in the 1970s, who is a feminist and wants to shed light on the issues that women wish to discuss and deal with in their daily lives. With publisher Doug Renetti (Jake Johnson), she launches the first women-only erotic magazine in history, which turns out to be more complex than they’d like to think.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Shane Brody, played by Taylor Zakhar Perez, is a firefighter and aspiring model who auditions for Joyce’s magazine spread. His attractive appearance and laid-back demeanor make him popular with all he meets. The premiere of&nbsp;Minx&nbsp;aired on HBO Max on March 17, 2022, and the show’s second season was ordered in May 2022. However, HBO Max canceled&nbsp;Minx&nbsp;in December 2022, although production on Season 2 was already underway. Nonetheless, Starz opted to pick up the series, so the debut of Season 2 is scheduled on 21 July 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-7-young-hungry-2015 data-injectable=false>7. Young & Hungry&nbsp;(2015)</h2><p data-characters=695 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>The second season’s&nbsp;Young & Hungry&nbsp;episode, “Young & Oh, Brother!” is an entertaining mix of comedy, drama, and kitchen mayhem. The episode is elevated by the presence of Taylor Zakhar Perez, who plays Benji Rodriguez. Benji, Sofia’s brother, visits San Francisco, and he’s all grown up, unlike the young boy Gabi remembers. Despite Sofia’s caution to avoid her younger brother, Gabi is overjoyed when the adult Benji asks her out on a date. Will Gabi’s advances put a strain on their friendship? Meanwhile, Josh and Yolanda will have to get resourceful if they want to pull off a bachelor party for Elliott on such short notice.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=694 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>However, when they implement their plan using a gay dating app, they all end up with more than they bargained for. Perez gives an excellent performance as Benji. He infuses the role with charisma, comedy, and honesty, making him an instantly endearing on-screen presence. Perez’s comedic timing is impeccable, and he consistently delivers hilarious lines without compromising his character’s integrity. His interactions with the other characters, especially Gabi, the show’s protagonist, are the source of most of the episode’s humor and warmth. Their on-screen connection is undeniable, and their interactions are among the episode’s most memorable moments.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-6-icarly-2012 data-injectable=false>6. iCarly&nbsp;(2012)</h2><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Taylor Zakhar Perez starred in an episode of the renowned Nickelodeon sitcom&nbsp;iCarly, titled “iGet Banned.” This episode, the fifth of the sixth season, debuted in 2012 and followed Carly (Miranda Cosgrove) and Freddie (Nathan Kress), who are irritated when they find that their apartment building’s doorman, the unpleasant Lewbert (Jeremy Rowley), has returned. Meanwhile, at the Groovy Smoothie, T-Bo (BooG!e) bans Sam (Jennette McCurdy) and Gibby (Noah Munck) for refusing to pay for their smoothies since they did not order the special bell peppers he included.</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Keith, portrayed by Taylor Zakhar Perez, is a guy who has feelings for Carly, which Carly finds appealing. At the Groovy Smoothie, he appears when Carly orders a caffeinated drink in an attempt to appear more mature and attractive to him. As a result, some humorous situations arise, adding to the comedy nature of the show. Despite its brevity, Perez’s appearance in&nbsp;iCarly&nbsp;was a significant professional milestone. His performance as Keith was a launching point for his acting career and demonstrated his comedic chops.</p><h2 id=h-5-embeds-2017 data-injectable=false>5. Embeds&nbsp;(2017)</h2><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>Embeds&nbsp;follows a group of young reporters who are embedded in a political campaign. Among them are five twenty-somethings, one of whom, Noah (Taylor Zakhar Perez), is a cocky trust-fund kid turned political reporter. Starring Don Tieri as the fictional Rhode Island governor, John Dobson, are television journalists Marissa (Kelsey Asbille), T. J. (Andre Jamal Kinney), Quinn (Max Ehrich), and Syd (Chloe Brooks).</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>They all work for rival networks and spend their whole time on the road covering Dobson’s primary campaign. While&nbsp;Embeds&nbsp;is a sitcom that intentionally mocks journalists, it does an excellent job of depicting the fast-paced world of political journalism, the isolation of the campaign road, and the hilarity of digital-era publishing. The witty script and snappy dialogue in Embeds are two of the show’s many lauded qualities.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-4-1up-2022 data-injectable=false>4.1Up&nbsp;(2022)</h2><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Kyle Newman wrote and directed the 2022 American comedy film&nbsp;1Up,&nbsp;starring Paris Berelc, Taylor Zakhar Perez, Hari Nef, and Ruby Rose, and released on July 15, 2022, by Amazon Studios. The plot revolves around Vivian “V” Lee, a gifted gamer whose abilities have earned her a college scholarship and a spot on Barrett University’s male-dominated squad, the Betas. The game begins when the Betas’ captain, Dustin, played by Taylor Zakhar Perez, reminds V that she will never be a starter.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>V recruits her best friend Sloane, and together with their coach Parker, they build a formidable all-female team intending to reach the nationals and defeat the Betas.&nbsp;1Up&nbsp;is significant because of the attention it has brought to the issue of prejudice and sexism in the eSports industry. The story deviates from the norm by emphasizing the accomplishments of female gamers.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-3-the-kissing-booth-2-2020 data-injectable=false>3.&nbsp;The Kissing Booth 2&nbsp;(2020)</h2><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=981 data-injectable=true>Taylor Zakhar Perez plays new student Marco Peña in the Netflix film&nbsp;The Kissing Booth 2, starring Joey King as Elle Evans. Marco is introduced as the new “hot” guy at school, which piques the students’ interest, especially the girls. Marco immediately becomes a school star due to his pleasant character, remarkable good looks, and impressive musical talent, proving he is more than just a pretty face. Marco is also tremendously gifted and regarded as one of the most incredible dancers in the school, having won the “OMG he’s so hot” competition.</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Marco may be well-liked, but he doesn’t fit the mold of the usual high school heartthrob. He’s a nice guy who doesn’t care where he stands on the high school popularity ladder, preferring to devote himself to his true love of music and dancing. In addition, he has a tender side that shines through most when he is with his loved ones. Marco becomes a trusted confidant of Elle when her relationship with Noah (Jacob Elordi) deteriorates over the distance. When the two decide to compete together in a Dance Dance Mania tournament, their friendship takes a romantic turn.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-2-the-kissing-booth-3-2021 data-injectable=false>2.&nbsp;The Kissing Booth 3&nbsp;(2021)</h2><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>The Kissing Booth 3 is the trilogy’s conclusion that began with the novel of the same name by Beth Reekles. The story follows protagonist Elle as she struggles with the decision between attending Harvard or Berkeley. At the same time, she and her loved ones spend the summer with her boyfriend Noah, best friend Lee, and their respective families as they prepare to sell their beloved beach property.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>When Elle decides to put off making her final college choice, the plot takes an unexpected turn. A parallel plot concerns Elle’s efforts to adapt to Linda, her father’s new lover. Taylor Zakhar Perez returns as Marco Valentin Peña. Marco’s presence provides a welcome contrast and a different romantic perspective amid Elle’s problem of choosing between Harvard and Berkeley and her troubled relationship with her boyfriend, Noah.</p><h2 id=h-1-red-white-royal-blue-2023 data-injectable=false>1.&nbsp;Red, White & Royal Blue&nbsp;(2023)</h2><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>American director Matthew Lopez and writer Ted Malawer are at the helm of the upcoming romance comedy&nbsp;Red, White & Royal Blue. Casey McQuiston’s 2019 novel of the same name inspires this film, which sets its beautiful LGBTQ+ love tale in an alternate universe and tells the narrative of a hidden affair between a First Son and a British prince. In&nbsp;Red, White & Royal Blue, Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) becomes the American version of a young royal after his mother is elected President. He is handsome, personable, and bright, making him very popular among young people.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=623 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=false>The only hitch is that Alex has a long-standing grudge against his British equivalent, Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine). And drama ensues when the tabloids get their hands on a photo of an incident between them. After family and officials stage a temporary ceasefire between the two, what starts as a superficial Instagram friendship soon becomes something far deeper for Alex and Henry. Nicholas Galitzine, Uma Thurman, Stephen Fry, Sarah Shahi, Rachel Hilson, and Ellie Bamber are just a few of the stars in the film’s ensemble cast.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video will debut&nbsp;Red, White & Royal Blue</a>&nbsp;on August 11, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZeytMCMrZiypJ%2BnerutyqGYq2Wgmr%2Bmxoympq%2BhlWKur7CMra1mq5ikxLR50ZqlpJ2UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
