She’s also worked on the shows “Night Court” and “The Fall Guy”, in which she appeared as Terri Michaels.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-riches-of-markie-post></span>The Riches of Markie Post<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of mid-2020, Markie Post’s net worth is estimated to be over $12 million, earned through a successful career in the acting profession, in the entertainment industry since the late-1970s.</p><p>Apart from television work, she’s also appeared in a few film projects during her career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-education-and-career-beginnings></span>Early Life, Education, and Career Beginnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Markie grew up in Palo Alto where her mother worked as a poet, while her father is scientist Richard F. Post, known for his work in the nuclear and magnetic fields. She grew up as the middle child of three siblings – the family later settled at Walnut Creek, California, where she attended Las Lomas High School. The school has been in existence since the 1950s, and is one of five schools in the area. She was a popular student, and a member of the cheerleading squad.</p><p>After matriculating from high school, she enrolled at the private Lewis & Clark College, in Portland, Oregon; she also spent a semester at Pomona College before returning to Lewis & Clark to complete her bachelor’s degree. After graduating in the 1970s, she realized she wanted to enter the entertainment industry, and began her foray as a part of the production crew of the game show “Split Second”, then continued with other production crews for shows such as “Pyramid”, “Double Dare”, “Card Sharks”, and “Password”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=transition-to-acting></span>Transition to Acting<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following her work in various game shows, Post found her entry as an actress in an episode of the show “CHIPs”. The crime show follows the lives of two California Highway Patrol (CHP) motorcycle officers as they handle various crimes in the area. Soon more work came her way, including appearances in “The Lazarus Syndrome”, “Hart to Hart”, and “Barnaby Jones”. She also made a guest appearance in the pilot episode of “Simon & Simon”, a show which would run for almost the entire 1980s.</p><p>Her early career was defined by these guest appearances, until in 1981 when she made her film debut in “Gangster Wars”, playing the character Chris Brennan.</p><p>The film starred Joe Penny and Michael Nouri, telling the story of several notable gangsters of the past, including Lucky Luciano and Bugsy Siegel. A year after this debut, she was cast in her first regular television role in “The Fall Guy”, of which she was a part for the next three years. The show aired on ABC and tells the story of several stunt performers in Hollywood, who work as bounty hunters on the side.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rise-to-fame></span>Rise to Fame<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After “The Fall Guy”, Markie found regular work in the game show “The $10,000 Pyramid”, and was also cast as a regular in “Night Court”, playing the character Christine Sullivan. The sitcom follows the story of an unorthodox judge named Harry Stone, as he presides at the Manhattan municipal court during the night shift.</p><p>The show was a reflection of the popularity of courthouse-focused themes during the 1970s, though “Night Court” was significantly more popular than its competitors such as “Sirtoa’s Court”.</p><p>She stayed with the show until its end in 1992, appearing in over 150 episodes in eight years. She didn’t take a break afterwards, as she gained another regular role in the sitcom “Hearts Afire” which partnered her with John Ritter. The show’s title is based on the song “That’s the Way of the World” by the band, Earth, Wind & Fire, and follows the story of a political reporter and a senator’s aide who begin to develop feelings for each other, despite being initially in conflict due to their respective professions.</p><p>The show took an unusual turn in its second season, changing the setting completely which ultimately proved to be its undoing, as it was canceled after its third season.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=recent-projects></span>Recent Projects<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1998, Post was cast in one of her few mainstream film projects in “There’s Something About Mary”, as the mother of Cameron Diaz’s character. The film also stars Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon, telling the story of men who are in love with the titular Mary, and are trying to win her affection. The film was one of the highest-grossing of the year, and gained numerous positive reviews; it’s considered one of the best movies of the 20th century.</p><p>After that she returned to television, working on “Odd Man Out” as a series regular, but the show was short-lived, lasting only a year, but she also had recurring roles in “Scrubs” and “The District”. In 2010, she shifted her attention to voice acting, and voiced the character June Darby, for 15 episodes of the show “Transformers Prime”. One of her most recent projects is the television series “Chicago PD”, in which she portrayed the recurring character, Bunny Fletcher. The show follows the story of officers who are members of the Chicago Police Department.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Markie met Stephen Knox while both were students at Lewis & Clark College. The started a relationship and eventually married in 1971, but it was short-lived, lasting only for a year. Her next marriage would be a decade later to writer Michael A. Ross, and the two have stayed together since, and have two children. During the early part of her career, she was known to be very elusive when it came to romances, as she was very conscious of her weight and didn’t want to go on dates that involved a lot of food. She also took on the bad girl stereotype in her projects, as they felt more of a natural fit to her, as she wasn’t like most of the prettier girls around her.</p><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=general-info></span>General Info<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Markie Post</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 4, 1950</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.67&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>110 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Lewis & Clark College, Las Lomas High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=family></span>Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Michael A.
