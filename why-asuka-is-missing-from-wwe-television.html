The Empress of Tomorrow was also one of the primary faces of the women’s division <a href=#>on RAW throughout the pandemic.</a> Many fans didn’t like how Asuka was booked after <a href=#>losing the RAW Women’s Championship</a> and they certainly notice her recent absence.</p><p>Fans realized Asuka’s absence from WWE television continued and this made many concerned about her status in the company. According to the <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter, </a>Asuka is doing fine and that she simply isn’t being used right now because, despite showing up to RAW’s television tapings, creative has nothing for her.</p><p>“For those asking about Asuka, she is fine. She’s just not being used for anything right now. She was at the Raw tapings early but left early since she wasn’t being used.”</p><p>We certainly hope Asuka will be able to make her return to WWE television as soon as possible as her inclusion is definitely needed on Monday Night RAW. She doesn’t appear to be injured, so fans might see Asuka find herself back on television after WWE gets over SummerSlam season.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
