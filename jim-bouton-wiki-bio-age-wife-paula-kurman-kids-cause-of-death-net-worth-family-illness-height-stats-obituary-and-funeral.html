He pitched at Western Michigan University before signing with the Yankees in 1958.</p><p>He was 21-8 with six shutouts in 1963 — his second season in the majors and his only year as an All-Star — and went 18-13 with four more shutouts in 1964. The Yankees lost the World Series both years, with Bouton losing his lone start in 1963 in New York’s loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers and winning twice the following year in the Yankees’ loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.</p><p>Bouton also pitched for Houston in 1970. He returned to the majors with the Atlanta Braves in 1978, going 1-3 at age 39. He finished his 10-year career with a 62-63 record and 3.57 ERA.</p><p>Bouton was a television sportscaster in New York City with WABC and WCBS, wrote other books, appeared in the 1973 movie “The Long Goodbye” and starred in a 1976 CBS sitcom based on “Ball Four” that lasted only five episodes.</p><p>Bouton shocked and angered the conservative baseball world with the tell-all book “Ball Four.” He worked on “Ball Four” in 1969, a season spent with the expansion Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros. Published in 1970, “Ball Four” detailed Yankees great Mickey Mantle’s carousing and the use of stimulants in the major leagues. Bouton’s revealing look at baseball off the field made for eye-opening and entertaining reading, but he paid a big price for the best-seller when former teammates and players and executives across baseball ostracized him for exposing their secrets. He wasn’t invited to the Yankees’ Old-Timers’ Day until 1998.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jim-bouton-age></span> Jim Bouton Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born on March 8, 1939 in Newark, New Jersey.
