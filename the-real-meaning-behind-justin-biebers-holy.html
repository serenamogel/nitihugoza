Justin <a href=#>sings</a>, "That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me .../&nbsp;Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy." The pop star also seemingly references the&nbsp;couple's ultra-quick courtship with the line, "Runnin' to the altar like a track star/Can't wait another second." Justin and Hailey have known each other and been friends for years, but it was in June 2018 that they reconnected at a religious conference in Miami, per <a href=#>E! News</a>. Justin <a href=#>popped the question</a> a month later, per <a href=#>CNN</a>, and by September of that year they had <a href=#>secretly tied the knot</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Justin also seemed to reference the fact that he and his wife waited until marriage to have sex with the line: "I don't believe in nirvana/But the way that we love in the night gave me life." Justin admitted to <a href=#>Vogue</a> in 2019 that his desire to consummate the marriage was at least part of the reason the couple got married so quickly, but added that wasn't the whole story.
