However, the YouTuber didn’t start showing off her boyfriend until November of that year. Gabbie wrote on one of their first Instagram posts about their romance, “listen ya’ll. I understand. YOU GET IT, I’VE GOT A BOYFRIEND. And please accept my sincere apologies for the bf spam. But, even before I was “on” social media, I was never open and public about who I was dating. But I just can’t help myself. I’ve never been with someone who made me want to shout from the rooftops about him. and I ran into that person. So this is me yelling. I’VE BEEN PUBLICLY SINGLE FOR 28 YEARS, SO PLEASE LET ME BE HAPPY. lmao&nbsp;”</p><p>Gabbie waxed poetic about her boyfriend, Payton, on Instagram, continuing the trend of showing each other love. “I despise being wrong, so it pains me to admit that all the cliches and love stories I’ve denied my entire life are so, very, undeniably real,” she began. This man entered my life when I least expected it when I wasn’t looking for him.”</p><p>Gabbie went on, “he is my soul-mate.” He inspires me to be a better person. He has given me so much peace and clarity. He is there for me, protects me, and believes in me. He is patient, kind, understanding, and an excellent listener. He’s artistic, inspiring, and the hardest worker I’ve ever met. He’s fair, generous, and exciting. He enjoys learning and sharing what he has learned with me. In every way imaginable, he is my other half and counterpart, and I can’t imagine my life without him. He’s walked through hell with me and has always been by my side.”</p><p>The YouTuber ended the post with the words, “I will love him until I’m dead and rotting, and then some.” My beautiful, supportive, kind, smart, [tall & handsome], patient, supportive, affectionate, selfless King, I adore you. I’ll be yours forever.”</p><p>Gabbie dated Andrew Siwick before meeting Payton. Gabbie and Andrew reportedly dated for less than a year. Neither confirmed or denied the relationship. Gabbie, who used to joke about being single before meeting Payton, once referred to one of her ex-boyfriends as a “pathological liar.”</p><p>Back to Payton and Gabbie, the YouTuber wrote a poem for their first anniversary and shared it on Twitter.
